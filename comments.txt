I manage UNO's social media at Mattel and love this photo. We'd like to share it from our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, may we have permission to do so? We would just need to confirm the photo is yours and would need your first name and last initial. 
Ayo I can comment now
Ok this one's blowing up so fast it might make top. good luck
I don’t remember seeing this in Donnie Darko.
I’ve got a conspiracy theory. The water is tinfoil. 
This is obviously filmed in Australia. Toilets there have what’s known as the Borealis affect.  

Edit:  sorry got confused, I’m so stupid, it’s not the Borealis affect it’s the Borealis effect.

I know a dude in high school whose family came from the south and they hang the confederate flag in their living room. I never knew until I went over. They were pretty nice and accepting. I was definitely freaking out, like looking back it seemed like a Get Out situation.

But from what he told me, apparently they just have a lot of southern pride. Can’t say that for all confederate flag owners. Maybe they were just very unique (we live in a relatively diverse area) or they were hiding lmaoo

UFOs don't take unleaded? 
This is Coyote! He used to run a party rental business. You could rent UFOs and other alien themed props (that he built) for your event. He lives near Jacumba Hot Springs, California.

He had a really cool "junkyard" full of old RVs, campers and furniture. It looked like something out of Fallout: New Vegas. Super neat roadside attraction stuff. But sadly, because of vandalism, he's scaled back quite a bit. [Read more about him here. ](https://roadtrippers.com/us/ocotillo-ca/attractions/coyotes-flying-saucer-retrieval-and-repair)

I used to have a huge crush on him during the Thriller era, the second to last in that row. It's a shame how insecure he was with his image. He was a great looking guy.
Is this a real thing I can download somewhere?!

The whole concept of yellow emoji is so nice and ‘universal’, the concept of race and skin color is irrelevant as it should be.

I think it was a really stupid and unnecessary thing to add different skin colors...

Why’d you do it Michael
This is going to sound awful but hear me out: I'm glad he's dead.

The man clearly had some deep-rooted issues. Had he lived longer I don't think any good would have come of it, especially given how the media likes to scrutinize celebrities' lives.

Also just look at his transformation as a person. He became scary to look at in his final form. Who knows what else would have happened given more time.


He went out on a good note and as a legend in the public's eyes.
