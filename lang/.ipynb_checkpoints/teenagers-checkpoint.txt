He is just a real hero
I really do hope those shitheads are brought to justice, I really do. Taking an innocent man's life for what?
[removed]
what‚Äôs his name
May he rest in peace. My condolences to the family.

Edit: Guys, please be more serious down there.
He is a Hero. We should remember he honoury act.
A fucking legend. Rest in peace
May he rest in peace

A true hero i cant imagine his mothers pain burying her son so frusturating about what our soceity became
As a mom, I can't imagine the absolute anguish she must feel to have suffered such a tragic loss right in front of her.. In her arms. Fuck.

Dude he was just trying to protect his mom and got stabbed in the fucking neck (SERIOUSLY THOUGH OW) fuck those people who killed him, i hope they rot in hell
Rest In Peace ‚ù§Ô∏è
I hope he is forever respected and remembered, and i hope the mom can recover from this
As someone who has been threatened with knifes several times I respect this guy as that is a terrifying thing to experience and I wish his family the best.
A beautiful man, in and out. Live forever in the stars, Hussain.
RIP, goodluck to his mother and family too :(
May he rest in piece. Just wanted to say here as an outsider of the uk, I hear that people carrying knifes and such are very common over there, obviously I don‚Äôt know that my self but for those who do, take care and don‚Äôt let others get hurt or possibly even worse
Context: the kid was known for selling designer jackets as he was studying law I believe, he was just hustling as these people planned the attack on him. Over fucking ¬£300 moncler jackets and now they're gonna do life in jail. Almost as stupid as the guy who killed a 13 yr old for ¬£150
Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun
He a real soldier RIP brother
Dont be saying F this man actually died
he looks like a super cool guy, I'm honestly not surprised that he sacrificed his life to protect his mother, that means he had a massive heart
True Hero. May He Rest in Peace. My condolences to the Family and Friends.
He is not a boy. He is a man that will be known as a legend. Respect

Rest in peace. A true legend.

May he rest in peace. If there is a heaven, surely he got in.
I almost cried when I was reading the story.

(he looks good)
Hussain chaudry, you deserve everything you want, you died for your mom, and that's you gotta gain respect

R.I.P Hussain
'he deserves to be known'

\*doesnt put in the persons name or anything\*
Rest in peace. He was a hero.
What a hero.
RIP hero
He's a son that every mother would ask for. Sending condolences to his family

Hope they suffer a long &amp; agonising death ! R.I.P
Why is nobody in the media enraged that in London someone can get stabbed and murdered for a jacket?! Are the Torys afraid that it will ruin their precious post-Brexit glow?!?!?
He has joined haven+
Imagine being such an awful human being that you not only break into someone's house to steal from them but kill a kid protecting his own mother.
I think he deserves the title 'man'

I mean this in zero disrespect but he looks like Hector Bellerin, what an absolute legend though, putting his life on the line for others
Of course with any horrible post like this there's a ton of wholesome seals
What a good boy rest in piece
was his mom okay?
Maybe put his name in the title if you want him to be known? Still, tragic and brave
You earned your seat in Valhalla my brother, you earned your seat.
Yet you didn't put his name.
Tell me again how gun control prevents violence?
If only his family had had access to some sort of device or multiple devices that could hurl projectiles at high velocity at their attackers from a safe distance. But does such a thing even exist? We may never know...

You also changed your hair‚Äôs direction.

Edit: ok guys wtf. Why did 1.1k people upvote this?

edit 2: y‚Äôall are bugging me about how more people are upvoting. but i gotta say, the rate of increase recently is staggering. did a bunch of people just randomly find the post? in fact, the rate averages to ~100/hr which lines up with the 100kg figure, so that‚Äôs cool.
Good job bro keep it up.
Holy shit I‚Äôm around 75-80 and this post wants me to get started on changing myself
Yes. Good job!
good onya cunt
mad, mad respect my zoomer I could never
I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight too! Good job on your process!
Yes, i am. 

I'm not proud of myself though, I'm underweight af.
[removed]
That's really fucking impressive! Way to go.
You look a lot happier I hope that keeps up!
Good job, now let's get you to a hairdresser.
Dude congrats! I went from 125 to 80 a while back and I know how much effort it takes. Props to you for getting up and going for it, it only gets better üí™
Congrats! You look massive in that second pic, how tall are you?
I'm built like a wire fence, can i have some of your kgs?
The hair swipe signifies power
He do be lookin kinda good doe
Great! Now put it back on in muscleüí™
Dam the hair swapped sides too
That's really impressive, id like to lose some weight myself, any tips?
Lol you was a unit
i like that grumpy man in the first pic
I will miss those glorious tits, though.. no homo.
Reddit stop recommending me 3 year old posts please, i literally dont care
This hit r/all and this old man internet stranger is proud of you. Keep it up, young blood but save some pussy for the rest of us
So fuckin proud dude. Weight loss is always such a journey, more for some than for others. Everyone would be better off with that willpower you seem to really have.
From big chonk to good sized chonk

I'm trying to get from small chonk to good chonk

But no matter the chonk size

Everyone is cool
Huge respect for your achievement. Also huge respect for finding the motivation for this. Can be hard.
I‚Äôm still not coming back son
If you don't mind, could you explain how you got to that weight in the first place?
What I'm proud is that you used metric system
Keep it up bro

If you are not already doing it, basically every exercise that needs you to use your legs is great, because your leg muscles are the largest and use the most energy en therefore make you lose weight the fastest. Cycling (slightly) uphill is great, and helped me lose 15KG in about two months
I think I realised, it's all in the hair! if you look closely the pony  also changed sides....
If my guess is correct its like a switch... Once you change it you can never go back!
(No, but seriously good job bro, keep it up)
Ah f now its my turn
One kilo below 100 isn't anything... Jokes apart you look amazing.. keep it up my man
CEO of being epic. Good stuff man!
The angry guy in the British flag shirt was too angry once you started losing weight and he left
That's amazing, I'm struggling to lose 10 kgs :(
I‚Äôm an old guy who never really took care of himself. I think you‚Äôre doing great and would suggest you keep the focus that got you this far. A lot of my current regret comes from never really taking myself seriously, or investing the time and effort into becoming the healthiest and best that I could pull from myself. Investment in yourself to the degree that you have shown here can bring you great things in life.
Pogchamp
Good job, how did you do it though I'm kinda in the same position you were what should I do?
if ANYTHING good can come from these recent shootings, it‚Äôs that we are no longer popularizing the gunman‚Äôs personal info and even their names. it‚Äôs a step in the right direction to decrease these situations.
We shouldn't have to see stories about this, Its insane. I hope his family knows just how much of a hero he is
The members of r/FRC, including myself and the rest of The Digital Devils, will wish his family the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Kendrick, you're a hero.
Please, be civil. This post was made to give respect to a hero, not to attack others with differing views. All arguing does is further divide us in a time where we need unity and to be a supportive community. 

Thank you.

I hate that stuff like this can happen, Just a few weeks ago my school was in lockdown for 3 hours because some kid brought a gun to school. Something needs to happen.
The fact that these kids had to put themselves at risk like this is ridiculous. I hope they‚Äôre resting in peace as we honor them for their bravery.
Today my friend was looking a little down. (We live in Colorado probably max 50 miles away). I asked him what was wrong and he said he lost his friend in the shooting yesterday. I had seen this making the respective rounds earlier and asked what his friends name was. He said the same name. I described him and my friend said I was describing his friend. I then told him about this. My friend then became less distressed and choked out ‚Äúat least I taught him something‚Äù.

Not looking for karma. Just want to share my story and hope that you remember people for who they were.
Fuck... some people are true heros
A dog got a statue for giving its life to save some kids, I‚Äôd say there needs to be statues for people like this but without telling anybody who the shooter was or if there was. Just say he‚Äôs a hero who saved people
Not all heroes wear capes
Wait another one happened?
[deleted]
What a fucking hero I dont have half the balls of this guy he gve his life to save everyone else. Real life inspiration. RIP
What about the other kids?
We have to remember to post this every year so we don't forget about him
Just a few weeks ago, every school in the state of Colorado was shut down due to a threat on the week of the Columbine anniversary. Less than a month later, we get one in the same state. The STEM school is less than twenty minutes from where I live. The Aurora shooting was five minutes away from me. Columbine high school is a little less than half an hour away. These are all in the same state and occurred in just a little more than 20 years. How many more now? Remember Kendrick Castillo, forget the shooters
I honestly thought this was gonna be some stupid ligma post but damn :,( we really lost a good one
adults have failed to save children, now children must save children.
Rest easy buddy üíî
God bless this damned beautiful man!
I am mind blown by stuff like this, scary part is it has become so normal, we forget about heroic acts like this due to how desensitised we have become.
I'm glad that media at least isn't giving fame to the shooter. I still fucking hate it that the media feed the Columbine shooters so much fame to this very day  


Still, it shouldn't come down sacrificing our lives to save our classmates.  These events tear a city apart, they must find a way to stop it. Praying for my aunt who lives in Colorado and has kids in school there
Weird that this is an ad for a self defense company. His actions are honorable, using it to sell shit is not. I don't think OP is shilling and just shared the picture but it's kind of crappy of them to slap their logo on it.
If anyone wants to work together on a project to help the families, the school, the community. Let me know. I am a designer-developer, I'll donate my time/skills for free. 

Rest In Power Kendrick, my heart feels for your family. I opened up my senior year scrap book last night...
Legends never die.

Hey /u/dinotrainer318,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
what compels people to do these shootings? what am i missing.. i don't get the motivation, is it just happening more because these people are inspired by the news? or is there some kind of 4chan type of place out there which fetishizes shootings and breeds shooters? im in school right now, and i can't imagine wanting to harm the mostly strangers i sit in class with, they are just there trying to get degrees/jobs/etc, why shoot them???
A fellow FRC kid and a hero. My prayers to his family and relatives.
Does anyone know what team number he was for FRC? I did it too and I'm wondering what team he was on
Training to properly react to a close quarters ambush is intense in the Army as an infantryman. 

Kendrick Castillo did it with no training as a student in a classroom, he is a Hero in my book.
They bullied the shooter to complications. This is actually horrible that the public school system will basically let this happen. It's because the public school system is a horrible place for like 50% of kids. There's social anxiety, and bullying. These kids are young and since they think they have nothing to lose so they go and do this. Schools can't just keep going "bullying is bad mkay". Kids are still slitting their wrists and depressed. This is a serious problem with the mental health of the kids in the whole country
This shit pisses me off. I am a survivor of a school shooting and nobody is stopping this shit. We see our friends lay down their lives and lose people every day because of this shit. I about lost one of my mentors, one of my friends about got their head blown off. I helped everyone get out and stayed in the back to make sure we didn't lose anyone, and I was going for the fire extinguisher as a back up. I want everyone on this sub to know that we are a community of support and we love you all. Stay safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Also - Should you ever been in this situation

* Throw things at them
* Use the fire extinguisher to blind them and suffocate them.
* If and or when they go down, kick the gun away
* Should they go down, break ribs and legs. Go for the motherfucking throat.
* Save everyone you can
* Keep safe
* Keep your cool.
Thank you Kendrick Castillo
Before we/the media go on our inevitable gun control rant, what about parents being better connected with their children? I believe they‚Äôre the first line of defense.
Test
*salutes*
Genuine question: don't the teachers instruct you to not play "hero" in these situations? That you should let the proper people tackle the situation?

I've no idea about the US, but this is what we get told in Sweden in case something happens. Last year someone tried to break into a (to me) nearby school with a knife, but gladly the doors got closed. We got an entire speech from the head teacher about this and what to do in a similar situation.

Answer this question....

Why, do some kids want to AND are actually more likely to try to murder their classmates now than vs decades past?

(hint, the answer isn't "guns". they are a part of the equation of "why are students being killed", but it isn't the answer to the above problem, which is the root issue)
I‚Äôve been involved in FRC my whole time in high school. We‚Äôre like family. This really sucks for everyone involved. Rest In Peace Kendrick, you‚Äôre a hero.
Kendrick is a hero. I wish he didn't have to be hurt saving those lives from someone who should not have thought killing people to let out thier anger was a good idea. I wish a lot of things and sadly that's all I can do. I wish I could make a change to all of this but no one knows how to stop it. I hate humanity. But also love it. I hate the side that thought this was a solution to their anger. But I love the side that saved lives.
[deleted]
I think the best part of these last few shootings has been absolutely no mention of the shooters, their motives or their pictures.

I don't know if the media finally decided to stop glorifying them or it's just been an accidental but I like it.
Sadly, I live only 2 miles from STEM. These past two days have been truly tragic.
Earth just lost its best defender. We will remember him.
Why joji always look so high tho
Shout out to the girl in my personal finance class saying ‚ÄúwHeN wIlL wE evEr uSe tHiS‚Äù
There are exceptions, but they are rare
Jojis cute asf
Looks like filthy frank
No printer here, just fax
As a teacher whose students made her cry today, thank you.

(I saved it until I got to the bathroom, but seriously.... Sophomores can be brutal.)
When you tell the student theyre being an asshole and they say that they don't care. Lmao
shoutout to the class clowns who think they‚Äôre funny disrupting the teacher when they rly just look dumb ü§ß
His counter ego recommended calling a suicide bomber if you wanna get out of school
There's always that one kid who does it.
And that‚Äôs a fact
Memes like this from you guys makes my job a bit more enjoyable ‚ù§
Teacher here. Thanks Joji! Wish you didn't say asshole at the end or I would post this on my class board.
thanks joji
NYESS B0SS
What about teachers who don‚Äôt deserve respect?
In general, yes, but some teachers are being straight up disrespectful to us students too, and if they're not gonna be nice to me then I'm not necessarily gonna be nice to them.
Is that filthy frank?
This morning a group of teenagers were standing in front of the only hallway near the main entrance and English wing (there‚Äôs currently construction going on in the auditorium so the closed off the other hallways leading up to the auditorium) and a hall monitor asked them to move since they were making it harder for everyone to get through, and one of the kids mocked the hall monitor after she asked them to move. I swear I wanted to punch him so badly. Not only for being a rude ass but for standing in the way.
High school math teacher here (saw this on the front page).

- Yes, I know you're struggling. I am here to help you.

- When I tell you to put your phone away, that's not because I hate you. 

- When I come back and tell you to put your phone in my bin, it's not because I'm the Phone Nazi who has a boner for stealing children's phones. It's because you are ignoring me to be on Reddit.

- Yes, I know that not everyone loves math as much as I do. That's why I do things like [make puzzles](https://i.imgur.com/tmpiCXY.png) and do Kahoots and stuff. But if I make something like that and you're just on Instagram (instead of a. Trying, or b. Asking for help), it makes me feel like shit. 

There are some shitty teachers out there (I've had a mix), but don't let that blind you to the ones who really do care. /rant
Depends on the situation tho
Unless your teacher is the town degenerate
PAPA FRANKU
People start to understand that when they get their first real job, especially the retail workers. We‚Äôre all just trying to get by in this world, don‚Äôt make it harder for others. I did my time as a tutor for middle school kids and it was incredibly mentally taxing. It wasn‚Äôt like a one on one tutoring, it was literally a small classroom. Never again.
I would normally agree but I‚Äôm this close to cursing out my band teacher cause he‚Äôs a moron
Unless the teacher is an asshole
This but it really sucks when your just trying to learn like a good student and the teachers are assholes but they don't care because they don't get paid enough :/ but yea lol
As a 26 year old teaching 7th graders, thank you for this. I get goofing around because I usually am myself, but the blatant disrespect and dumbfuckery ruins it for everyone.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm leaving this subreddit
If only **SOME** of my classmates knew that. They keep repeating "we don't want to be here". Yeah, everyone knows that. Why repeat it over and over again?
What if your teachers abused you?
Unless the teacher makes your life unbearable
I first read it as Jojo
What if they‚Äôre the fucking asshole
You posted this in 2 different subreddits so I was hella confused why I saw this twice in a row on my homepage lol
Unless your teacher is a price of crap and doesn‚Äôt care about their students this is true
I am a rookie teacher. Dont know if I'm doing good or not.

Maybe I deserve some. Hopefully I pick up the pace next sem.
i miss filthy frank so much
He's still Filthy Frank to me.
My wife is a teacher and a councilor for indigenous youth. She was a junior high dropout (though she obviously got her act together). This is truth.
Why should we just blindly respect these teachers? Way too many of them are actually just there collect a check. They really enforce the theory that you learn best when you teach yourself. Some of these teachers really don‚Äôt seem like intelligent people. They get paid too little? If that was true it would have corrected itself by now. Their compensation stays that way because they are irrelevant to a students success. They‚Äôre really just babysitters that log how good your memory is.
My mom does this shit all the time. One time she walked up to me and said you are always sitting around on your ass watching anime so we thing you should do something else with your time and pulled out a fucking laptop
She got me 2 until i saw her smile
I knew it was going to be something like this when she took it and gave the package and gave it back to em
this video is older than my dead grandma
I would be bawling my eyes out before i even opened it. Cuz i dont like people yelling at me. Even if its as a prank.
He went from üò® to üòÄ
That scared the crap out of me.
Before I saw her smile at the camera I was horrified for the kid, I felt literal flashbacks of my mother doing this to me, I honestly felt so bad
Wholesome asf. Kid is like in his 20‚Äôs by now though
Dang, i wish my mom loved me
I want to award this but I'm too poor so here's a virtual hug
Idk cheif

"I'm gonna wear you butt out"

Seems like the kid is used to that kind of threat, too
I always love that ending.
He was more relieved that he didn't get his ass beat than he was happy to get the gift.
I dunno. I feel like yelling at your kid, threatening him and terrifying him for a prank is kinda horrible? I know the kid looks happy but idk. It makes me really uncomfortable
the gift is nice but i think that putting your kid under false anxiety and threatening them is wrong. I understand the good intention but poor kid

edit: spelling
"I'm gonna wear your butt out"

I'm no expert, but I don't think threats of physical violence work all that well. Maybe she was just joking, but there are parents out there that would be serious. We do not need to normalize child abuse by calling it "discipline."
I hope this kid is doing fine now.
she could surprise him without being a bitch in the process.
I would have been happy if I at least got that kinda hug from my mum...I never asked gifts and never got one too. But for 13 years I am yearning for a hug. 

I AM CRYING SEEING AT THIS...seeing this continuous for 10 minutes
What the fuck does this have to do with teenagers
As someone who grew up with a lot of trauma... this stressed me the fuck out. Idk how anyone thinks this is cute but okay.
That is so evil
... why the fuck put your eight year old kid through the emotional distress of getting yelled at and fear of getting beaten for no reason. Just give him the fucking present like a normal human.
This pisses me off. This is exactly like that shitty Jimmy Kimmel halloween cany "Prank." Its hardly okay to prank your children, especially when they are so young. Breaking the foundation of trust between yourself and your kid for the meme isn't the way to go.
I started to tear up cause this was such a precious rollercoaster pf emotions. Loved this
Idk if I would've gone that far. I would've just hid it made him go on a scavenger hunt for it.
Why do so many people do this shit? So fucked up
I hope you blocked her.
Looks like another one for the "Fuck you, not cool" pile
Something like this actually happened to me.
 I asked out a girl. I asked her on Messenger and she said she liked me too. I thought its real. This happened at evening after i got home. On the morning she said it was a lie and "her friends from her school told her to do so" even through they don't even know me.
 So it was just a joke i believed in.

EDIT: Thank you guys for all the replies. Here is a little bit more detail for those who care:
 We hanged out in a big company. That evening i asked her if she was going to hang out tomorrow but she said that she can't. I said ok and then she asked if i have girlfriend. I said no and i asked her the same she said no. Then she asked if i have crush on someone. I said no because i thought she would think that i have crush on other girl and not on her. She said she haves crush on someone but refused to tell me who.
 At this moment i decided its time to tell her that i have crush on her and she said that I was her crush...
Well she said on the morning it was a lie and she actually haves crush on other guy... Just a joke...
Fuck her dude, you can do way better then her. She don‚Äôt deserve you. She‚Äôll realise her mistake and then it‚Äôll be too late cos you‚Äôll have found yourself a fine ass lady. Keep that head held high.
A girl that does that is just a person that will use people till they die and will do anything for popularity and is very loud and annoying 


I would know because I used to have a crush on one of those girls and she manipulated my love into want she wanted and would always prank me after me saying I don't I like it and she took my Dino-nuggies aswell. Srry for the rant
[deleted]
No matter who you are, don‚Äôt do this garbage. It‚Äôs not funny, it‚Äôs just mean, and the receiving end of the ‚Äúprank‚Äù has every right to be mad
Words cannot express how angry I am at this girl
why do I feel like this is fake
[removed]
If that girl needs to exploit others for the sake of internet points then fun fact, she is bad at being popular and getting internet points.  I really hope that more people realise that this stuff is wrong, and that there is absolutely no good reason to do this kind of shit to others
Yup. And then we get told to toughen up or ‚Äòman up‚Äô
As a girl, this shit makes me angry.

I've literally had something similar happen to me 3 years ago, what a prick, I hope karma hits them that they'll know how you felt

Dudeee that's so fucking shitty, I'm sorry man
Had almost the same situation happen to me
The actual f is wrong with people. You'll find someone who likes you and it's clearly not this girl. F her and Don't lose hope!

what car is that
zoomin in the foreign, got the engine roarin
Time to commit vehicular manslaughter
Do donuts in the snow
Congrats!
Old guy here.  Now that you have the car, learn to maintain it.  Learn to change a tire, check your fluids, change bulbs, and learn how to do basic diagnostics (learn what different noises mean, how to diagnose a check engine light, etc).  It's all easy stuff that'll save you time and headache later.
What car is it
OP's mom here, seriously, no shit, I'm her Mom.

Thanks for all the great advice. If someone wants to copy/3D print a new key go ahead! Can't be worth you time or effort.

Please stop telling her to drive it like it's stolen, though I did the same thing 30 years ago with my first car.
I like ur hoodie
In the trunk: bag of kitty litter or sand, folding shovel, flares,  spare old pair of beater boots and wool socks, old wool blanket or spare sleeping bag.

In the seat pocket:  paper atlas of your area, flashlight. Small towel for wiping off fogged-up windshield. 

In the glove compartment: $20 cash. Piece of paper with ACTUAL PHONE NUMBERS of most important family contacts. 

Stashed somewhere: piece of paper with your important insurance/registration, maybe your debit/credit card.

If you live somewhere where you might be driving through nowheresville, consider adding a tarp.

If you keep a cardboard box in the back seat and ALWAYS ALWAYS chuck stuff in instead of all over the place, and clean it out when it gets full, your car will be neater, and if you ever have to change a tire, you can fold the box flat and kneel on it.

Go to Ocean State Job Lot and get some area rugs or rubber mats and put them over the current floor mats; chuck them in the spring.

When you get in the car, sit down then turn sideways and hang your feet outside and clap them together three times to knock most of the crap off. 

KEEP RECORDS of your mileage and notice when it drops. Find out why. Might be the temperature, or you might need a tune up. KEEP YOUR TIRES FILLED CORRECTLY.

KEEP RECORDS of your oil changes and repairs. When you go to sell it you'll get a better price if the buyer knows you've stayed on top of things.  

If you hear a weird noise, pay attention. Does it happen only on uphills? Down? Level? Only when you're accelerating or coasting or turning right or left? You'll get points for trying when you talk to a mechanic. 

First time you need something fixed, listen to what they tell you, then whip out your phone and say "Hey Uncle Bob, they say I need X widget and it's going to cost Y" even if you don't have an Uncle Bob. 

DO YOU KNOW HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE?

Don't forget to establish dominance in your car.  
Your friends may want to play with your radio, change stations, change songs, etc.  
It's your car, and you're driving so you choose what to listen to.  
They may make requests, but you are the ruler of the castle.
Who down voted this? What‚Äôs the reason lmao
Congrats
Why did you downgrade from a tank??

u/blondy712 I‚Äôm curious as to why this became a meme.... but congrats! 

Also how do you feel about the fact that your face is on every other post in this sub out of nowhere?

last meme of 2020
Congratulations, you've gotten your own KnowYourMeme page!
Congratulations! Now be careful not to lose control on the winter road conditions. I recently crashed my first car because I wasn't careful enough in a turn, so take it slow and you should be just fine :)
Those keys seem like housekeys lol
Aaaaaand she‚Äôs a meme
So this is where your journey began. Who knew you would end up owning so many vehicles.
If I may ask, how the fuck can you afford insurance.

I saved up enough for a car, and then insurance slapped me in the face with that 350+/month rate, so I never bought a car.
You have turned into the biggest meme congratulations
Good on you. I got my first std todayüòÅ

Wow, that's cool dude
I named my first car Charlotte. She a hoe

Once someone was gonna shoot my school it was when we were in lunch time and there‚Äôs always a police officer there so when he was pulling out the gun he got tackled
Let me guess, that school in Arlington? Glad you're safe man, that's a fucking terrifying experience
Man, wtf, there was just one a few days ago in Texas
I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that.
You good man? Your friends ok?
&gt; Redditor accidentally doxxes themselves
[deleted]
Are you ok? What happened?
That's smart asf that you guys barricaded the door. Can you describe what happened when you were informed there was a school shooter?
I heard about a school shooting in Texas, is this it?
i'm so glad you're not hurt
There was a rumor going around that an active shooter was at one of the schools in my area. I say rumor because that was false, the police confirmed it, but it didn‚Äôt actually hit me what that could have meant until like an hour ago. Shits scary.

Oh and if I remember correctly that‚Äôs the 5th THIS WEEK. Not the 5th rumor the 5th school shooting this week.
at least you are alive.

edit: who the fuck gave the post a "Table Slap Award"?
this is probably why I don't want to go to a school with life threatening situatuions

is everybody safe?
**DO YOU LIVE NEAR ARLINGTON TEXAS**

There was a school shooting there today and if so I live literally 20 min away from where that happened
Yeah I've been hearing about school shootings happening everywhere recently, in fact there was even a threat at my school, stay safe man üëç
damn hope everyone‚Äôs alright. that‚Äôs the real shit.
I saw this, glad your safe
This is a very calm post for such a traumatic event.
That must have been fuckin terrifying
Jesus fucking Christ. I‚Äôm sorry you and your classmates had to go through this. Goddamn it. Fuck.
Yeah those barricades held up well‚Ä¶
I just found [this on Tiktok ](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM81FRWF1/), this country is something else
Jesus there‚Äôs still shootings
Actually my worst nightmare
My school had a shooting back in 2017. I strongly encourage you to go to therapy after this. Some of the worst moments of your life just happened out of nowhere. Hope you‚Äôre okay
why they all bald tho üíÄ

Was this in Arlington?
Tell me you live in USA without telling me you live in USA
Being a student in America is terrifying because you have to always worry about something like this happening. Really sucks that happened to you man. Hope things get better

How is this considered normal in america? Why doesn't anyone do anything about it?

Ah yes I slept with my parents, my brother, my cousins and my aunties when I was 7.
Reminds me of the time when I was to scared to sleep in my own room and my mom really wanted me too. She asked me "What will happen when you're an adult and out of the house?" I responded by saying "But don't couples sleep with eachother?" Not a fun conversation
So, for the longest time, I thought the word ‚ÄúPussy‚Äù was used to insult someone by referring to their cat-like qualities...I mean an actual cat‚Äîno innuendo...Iike the person wasn‚Äôt as friendly as a dog, or they only showed affection when they wanted something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Same reaction when I wondered why it was so bad to have a drink while you drive.
Did someone figure out why is it bad ?
I remember my friends asking if I ever slept with someone and I answered "yeah, a lot of times" thinking of when I slept next to my mom.
They looked confused as hell
Could be worse, when I was 8 I asked my parents what a prostitute was. "Someone who sells their body for money." Fast forward to seeing an amputee the next day. Hey mom look, a prostitute!
Literally me when my parents were talking about their one friend with a "drinking problem"

I legit said "what's wrong with drinking water?"
*What movies were 7-year-old you watching*
I thought people made babies by kissing each other
This is the first post to make me laugh out loud in a while so I'll give you a follow, a save and this üéñ
When I was a little kid, my aunt annoyed me so I called her a "horror".

As in, a scary monster like Frankenstein or the Wolf-Man.

Obviously, she heard a different word and complained to my mother.

My mother told me not to call women "horrors" and I asked why.

She said the word meant women who slept with a lot of men and in my child brain, I imagined a girl on a cot in a room filled with men sleeping on neighboring cots.

I never did figure out why that was so bad.
Relatable
i once got the word pussy and wuss confused and said it at school to my friend in a joke, i had no idea why he looked shocked
When I first came to the us in 6th grade my friends told me ‚Äúcum‚Äù was the fruit juice I was drinking and I believed them until after I said ‚Äúyeah I like cum‚Äù and they all laughed at me and my other friend who spoke Spanish said it was semen
I'm a simple man, I see a veggie tales meme and I upvote
In middle school, my school held a Volleyball Marathon overnight and this couple was telling people they were sleeping together because they set up their sleeping bags against one another.
This was me in the 4th grade. My teacher‚Äôs husband was deployed and a classmate asked her ‚Äúdo you miss sleeping with him?‚Äù
And she said you ‚Äúyou have no idea how wrong that sounds.‚Äù
Not related to the post but I just need comment karma to livestream me playing Tetris 99 :(
When I was little I would sleep over with a friend of mine and we would sleep on the air mattress together, and when people started talking about ‚Äúsleeping with‚Äù boys I was so confused what the big deal was, cuz as far as I knew I had been doing it since I was, like, 5! LMFAOO
I actually had no idea what 'sleeping together' meant until I was 16.
u/vredditdownloader
Meanwhile: At 7, I discovered porn.
I thought you used up a ball to make babies...

When I explained my theory to my grandpa at a family get together he asked me how people have more than two kids then everyone laughed at the confused/shocked look on my face as I tried to work out how else babies could happen.
Well, when mommy and daddy love eachother very much, strange noises come out of their bedroom and the sheets are sticky when you come into their room for cuddletime. Daddy also seems to have keys in his pocket. Must investigate later.
Very realistic to my 5 year old days
I used to think sex back in the day was just making out and then it turned into what sex actually is
For years I thought that sleeping in the same room as someone who you aren't married to was bad.

I had no sleepovers until I was like ten and even then I was confused.
Wait, so sleeping with your uncle is not normal?
when my friend  told me that selena gomez and justin bieber slept together and i was like ‚Äú...so? we do that all the time üòï‚Äù
Me at 8 thinking being a virgin meant you never had a crush on someone and therefore I thought I lost my virginity in kindergarten
I didn‚Äôt get what sleeping together meant until like a year and a half ago
Look, even if they said "I can't believe you fucked her" my 7 year old mind would have thought that it was just a bad business deal or something.
7 years old these days understand it better than adults
I vividly remember asking my parents ‚Äúwhy do mommies and daddies sleep naked?‚Äù And them explaining that people don‚Äôt sleep naked
Well, you see, when two sleepy people like each other very much...
I sleep with my sister
Nice you're staying positive
If you die can you keep us posted on how it‚Äôs going?
Just wanna tell you that YOU'RE BREATH TAKING!
uhh, what happened? I'm sorry for being that guy but i'm curious
dont die or ill fucking kill you
You're right. You are cute. Just don't die fromxla heart issue

Edit 2: I'm literally exaggerating. If your gonna tell me not to assume about op's family, then stop assuming about my comment.

Your grandmother seems woke as fuck.
Man, I wish other old people understood mEmEs, your grandma is truly epic
Plot twist: your aunt is actually an Oklahoma Sooner fan and your grandma is a Texas fan
Probably fake but I'll just pretend it's not cause the thought is too funny
This made my fucking day thank you so much
The security guard didn‚Äôt even expect it to actually be on fire and then he looked inside and 0-0
Teacher: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you go to the bathroom during breaktime?‚Äù

The bathroom during breaktime:
Ok but what happened in the aftermath
Just get close to it and spray it with your hose
That's just public toliets
‚ÄúYo the restroom‚Äôs on fucking fire bruh‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ho on fire‚Äù

‚ÄúAy pull the fire alarm bruh‚Äù

‚ÄúThat bitch is ENGULFED in flames!‚Äù

‚ÄúWE FIDNA BLOW UP! WE FIDNA BLOW UP!‚Äù
Yo wtf?

Edit: update.

No injuries reported. Only damage to restroom. Some people claim to know who did it, but nothing solid yet.

Another edit: no I did not torch my schools restroom.

Hi, r/all
Taco Bell hitting like
Meanwhile in the men‚Äôs bathroom
Happened twice at my high school. Last time it happened i was taking a shit when the alarm went off, so I took my time and finished up assuming it was one of the many false alarms. 

When i came out of the stall there was a six foot flame coming out of the garbage can by the sinks

The worst part wasn‚Äôt the fire. The kid in the stall next to me was a kid who is blind and mostly deaf, i had get his attention and lead him out of the stall. Only reason i knew he was there was because he makes a type of sound as a mild form of echolocation so you always know its him when you hear the sound.

These pranks are wild and all but I don‚Äôt think anybody considers that someone like the disabled kid could end up being a horrible accidental victim
Pee on it
THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED IN MY SCHOOL AN HOUR AGO WTFFFF!!
One kid at my middle school tried to light a cigarette and burnt toilet paper and the same thing happened. He was suspended for the 11th time (our school had no expulsion policy and was K-8)
Holy shit, sorry, fiery shit
*Starts fire. Pulls out phone.* "SoMeOnE sTaRtEd A fIrE!!!!
yo we go to the same school lmaooo shit was cold outside
Yo





You got working stall doors?
why is that guy recording and not telling somebody or getting a fire extinguisher
I guess you could say the toilet was pretty hot :)
why tf did someone set fire and take a shit in the juulroom? Wtf is wrong with people
That guy looks so nonchalant about it as if it happens every day
Explain to me how the fucking bathroom can be set on fire. There's barely anything flammable there

[...] There is concern that mobile execution units have made organ harvesting much easier and more profitable, as lethal injection does not damage the body."

Please remember¬†this isn't xenophobia or racism or a direct issue with the Chinese people but an issue with their autocratic leader and his government. As well as western companies support of that and their attacks on their own customers I.e.¬†***us.***

Happy cake day
I‚Äôm 36 and what is this
Man, Dave (the farmer in the meme) is making his way around Reddit now. I‚Äôll have to show him next time I see him. He‚Äôs really a nice guy and runs a really successful business besides being a full-time farmer. 

Funny thing is, most farmers have full-on computers in most of their equipment: monitoring crop yields, precisely applying fertilizer, and GPS-enabled auto-steer so they can cover every square inch of field perfectly. If any old person isn‚Äôt going to know how to use a computer, it won‚Äôt be a farmer.
This is literally the worst and most low effort meme I have ever seen in my entire life, why does it have 90k fucking upvotes?
lol, clever.
Much but it‚Äôs honest 
Much but it‚Äôs h work
It ain‚Äôt much, hnest work

i sell phones and i get a lot of older folks who come in like lost helpless invalids bc they mess with a setting or dial a wrong number or turn down their brightness, etc. etc. anyway we had this one guy come in angry as wasp telling us he‚Äôs been on the phone with straight talk for six hours and been on hold with different 1800 numbers and nobody can tell him why his youtube videos are downloading to his ‚Äúsims‚Äù card and why he can‚Äôt get any phone calls. we tell him that youtube videos don‚Äôt save to sim cards which he absolutely defended and told us we were wrong. then we go into his settings... do not disturb is on, calling is off, alarms are off, cellular data is turned off. he still thinks his youtube videos are on his sim

At first everyone was hyped
I don't know if I'm the only one feeling this way, but the quarantine lifted a lot of stress off my mind.
School is starting in three days for me. Im already stressed because of it
I was hyped in the before time now I wish to go back
quarantine has made me fall into a horrible depressive episode üòÄüëç
i had that hoodie
I thought it was just gonna be for Monday lmao
The day before quarantine my sister said that she wanted a longer weekend, now I've been stuck at home for about 6 months
I‚Äôm starting in five weeks and one week I‚Äôll go to school, the other will be online and so on and so forth and I don‚Äôt if I‚Äôm happy or not...some part of me is happy because I miss getting out of the house, but the other part is not because I forgot how it was to go to school...
Three weeks of what?
Haha. I've done nothing for five months strait. I'm a depressed mess now.
idk i liked not having to go to school, doing it online was beautiful
I've been doing the same thing i would be without quarantine: makin' games and playin' games
I'm not going to lie, i was super excited for the quarantine. After online school ended i felt myself starting to want to go back to school, but now the school is around the corner for me i don't want to go back
My family is toxic af so I can't wait for school
me doing art as a quarantine hobby,,,,,mom bought me a drawing tablet in March just when lockdown began!!!
The only thing quarantine has done to me is make me lose all my friends
I‚Äôm one of the few people that don‚Äôt want to go back to school
Im acctually loving extra long summer. I fucking hate school so :/
I start in September, gonna be wacko
I am seriously annoyed by this quarantine . I just want to go back to classroom study . Its the best ! Here in India , online classes are being conducted , which are not that much effective .
I got 1 day.
I was horribly depressed and gained a bunch of fat, then I kinda vibed and now I‚Äôm working out a ton and I‚Äôm happier
Finally got together with a girl I'm now in love with because of the quarantine.
My depression has strengthened in the last five month. I already had depression pre-quarantine, but my parents have said stupid things and are overprotective of me. Henceforth, I have severe depression.
I mean I'm introverted + a gaming fanatic + loving writing reviews about video games so this is litteraly my paradise
I‚Äôm so introverted that this is nothing new to me, my lifestyle hasn‚Äôt changed one bit
[deleted]
I don't know how I'm gonna function normally after everything goes back to normal
Quarantine was the best thing to happen to my grades, I got all A‚Äôs on my report card
I‚Äôm bored of video games, movies, and tv I hate to say it but school is where most of my friends are so that‚Äôs why I want to go back
School didn't start for me either. I feel so bored. Almost 6 months at home. I don't mind i am an proud gamer but i can't stand my parents anymore. Someone send help
it's not like i didn't consistently feel even worse when going to school so im fine staying as long as possible
Bro, in March my school only gave us 2 days off for coronavirus and then we ended up having the rest of the year off
Mine don't start till next month
Everyone is complaining about being bored but I‚Äôm still enjoying quarantine
That's the exact position I'm in rn, with the lights off at 6AM
December be like: man..
I remember being in class. My school and teachers are British and know to expect the worst and they were like you SHOULD be back in a month but we are fully expecting 5o see you after the next school year. I was so excited about that prospect and now I'm here wishing for school to start even though I'm going into y11
by now i just want summer break to end
Lol I‚Äôd be fine for another year, I have to go back to school in 3 days and I am not looking forward to it.
School started for me today again and already what my free time back
*i wonder what those tissues on the floor are*
I think I start again in september, and we'll have to wear masks when we aren't in at our desks and wash our hands every time we move around.
I am just starting highschool and I basically don't know any of my classmates. I hope we can start the year properly and not through home office.
*off
Off not of
Haha I wish my room were that clean
I was so excited then. God how wrong I was.
PLEASE LET ME GO BACK TO SITTING ALONE I HATE SCHOOL
lmao its still here
Ayooo dude come here
"It's a boy!"

"Yaay!"

"..."

"Aren't you gonna name him?"

"What? He doesn't have a name? I was waiting for one of you doctors to call him by his name."
My first day of high school when I met my friends, I only found out one of their names like 3 weeks later
It is surprisingly easy to interact with someone not knowing their name... generally you only need it when talking with a third person... and then you can admit your shortcoming haha
When we got a new employee where i work, i spent over a month calling him Matt. He always responded to matt so that must be his name. Awesome! Im usually really bad at remembering names. 

His name was Ben.
I didn‚Äôt know my friends name was Julian till the second semester
I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes.
I mean in school you just know but elsewhere just call them bro or smth
Or we just say dude or bro
I'm an introverted girl, and I must confess... sometimes I never learn people's names either because I'm too shy to ask. I just avoid calling them anything until somebody says it.
-Be me

-Go on gym with parents

-met some guy 20+

-you forgot his name 5 minutes later

-still go to gym for 4 years

-you got invited on this dude wedding

-heard his name durning cerenomy

-now you remeber it

- 1,5 year later saw this meme

-try to write this story

-realised you didnt went to gym because of covid and durning this time you forgot this dude's name AGAIN

-fuck
What if I do that with everyone
Why would I introduce myself?
Ah yes, this is the same predicament I find myself in with my 3 friends, bro, dude, and man
That was the way I discovered the name of my first best friend, even just knowing him for like 2 minutes before hearing his name while the teacher was seeing in everyone was there
Your name is ‚ÄúYo‚Äù until I hear someone say what it is
I once talked to a guy about cars for like two hours and still to this day I have no idea what his name is
True story I called my future best friend bro for a whole semester
I forgot my 5yr friends name the other day and just waited 30 minutes not addressing them till someone said it lmao
i didn't knew the name of a person in my school (some years ago), spent half a year ignoring her.
Or when you forget someone‚Äôs name but don‚Äôt want to see rude, so you get them talking to their friends and wait to hear their name.
Also - intuition.
I do this when I forget somebodys name. I kinda like.. stalk them and wait till I hear their name then talk to them
Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
I sat with a guy for 4 days and we didn't ask each other name until he broke the ice and asked me so we never told each other our names
Me: You have a really cool name. How do you spell it?

Guy: T I M
It‚Äôs called a handshake gesture, followed by ‚ÄúHey my name is, ________.  What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù
maybe its just covid or my shy ass but i dont remember actually asking someones name
Worked as a scorekeeper for local city softball leagues for years. Players would constantly say "Hey **'keep**, what's the score?". Good ol' Andy, hearing my name for months at this point comes over and says "Hey **Keith**, what's the score?" My name isn't Keith. Bless Andy's heart.
I normally ask immediately so I know what to scream as he bangs me
Wait girls introduce themselves?
When I used to play basketball at the gym before covid, I knew so many people but I never knew their names.
When I started hanging out with my friend group I knew everyone's name cause we got to know each other working at the same place and I saw them on the schedule. One of them though liked to go by his middle name too which I didn't know and when we made a snap group chat I had no idea who he was for like a week
I was a manager at a gas station. Saw the same guy everyday. We became friends. Went fishing. Got drunk. Got high. Met his entire family. Hung out for a year. I still have no clue what his name is.
You mean... We wait until the other guy leaves and then everyone talks about him.
Moms be like "oh you have a new friend, what's their name?" Idk, I've never had someone else refer to them by name.
I still don‚Äôt know half of the names of the people I speak to in maths, beca Nobody‚Äôs said there name yet. I‚Äôve known them for over 2 years, but only really talked to them for 3/4 of a year
Why though? Why do we do this? As a father of small children, I often pick up conversations with other dads at the playground. There's one in particular that I probably see 3-4 times a week. I know the names of his kids, that he has rats in his basement that he's trying to catch but I still don't know the dudes name. Can't bring myself to ask after weeks of conversations.

"All right man, see you soon I'm sure...hey, by the way...what is your name?"
Yep that‚Äôs how it works, talked to a guy for a solid year we both just called each other bro and dude until o heard his name and he heard mine from someone then we addressed each other by name XD
Instant nicknames...or dude, guy, homie, bruh, bro, etc. Who cares about names, really...if it's important, they make us wear it on our shirt somewhere.
First day of 7th grade bio I sat with a group of guys I never met before and didn‚Äôt learn their names for a month I‚Äôm still close friends with one of them to this day
Who the hell doesn't introduce themselves when they meet someone?
Your girlfriend or wife introduces you and then you don‚Äôt speak unless you have to.
i‚Äôm taking notes
I can relate to that and now i want to cry
I got a compliment about 13 years ago from a random girl in an amusement park that I had nice glasses (was wearing my BCG's) and i still remember it like it was yesterday.
Getting called sir at a restaurant is enough for me to go back
I still remember that I got called cute two years ago at a school event. Jessica if your out there, I'm sorry I fucked up the convo :(
I got complimented 2 days ago that I smell nice lmao
Well yeah, this completely explains how "being nice" is so often mistaken from "flirting". Women are used to compliments all the time, women imagine you rarely ever received a compliment and then some cute guy was being nice and gave you one. You'd fall for him too.
Any other girls going through comments taking mental notes? üòÇ
Boys should definitely be complimented more! Like I tell my guy friend that his hair is nice and he's completely bowled over because people don't think to compliment him?? Ridiculous. You guys are cute and awesome (as long as you're not dickheads).
I haven‚Äôt had a compliment for as long as I can remember.
I‚Äôm in this image and I don‚Äôt like it
Hey bro, nice post 


This will last the whole day
[removed]
That's normal!? Thank God! I thought I was just a creep.
I remember a comment.

" Once a girl complemented my eyes, I have been keeping them since."
You may have fooled a normal virgin, but I'm a turbo virgin with zero confidence!
hey, i can‚Äôt physically see you but i can tell from this post that you‚Äôre really cute :)
If I get a compliment I immediately get suspicious that I am being played.
Men you God‚Äôs hype yourself up. Look in that mirror and say DAYUM your hair looks fresh today. Nobody feelin me but ME today and I smell clean as heck, hype your boys up too when you see em we gotta keep the positivity going for outselves


Edit: New plan boys, you just need to get better at talking to girls. Or lower your standards.
Even a glance in our general direction might do it.
And it‚Äôs why so many dudes are desperate

The first girl to fart in their direction and suddenly they have a crush despite not knowing lick about the girl
Oh wow...well....boys! You all look really nice today! And I love u :)
My crush looked at me and smiled, I'm calling that a small W
Girl: hey that color looks good on you 
Me: * proceeds to get on one knee
Just another thing, I‚Äôm pretty sure more than 90% of guys in this sub have attempted to suck their own dick. It‚Äôs just a fact
[deleted]
Whoa, is that me?
Maybe I'm just ugly but I compliment guys all the time and I'm still invisible to them. That's fine right now though because I have a partner.
Somebody tell me i'm ugly so i can feel better about myself
The last time I received a compliment was about 3 years ago saying my hair is smooth. Still not forgetting that moment
Last week at the beach, a really pretty woman with tattoos and a nose ring told me she liked my beard.

I've thought about it everyday since lol
Old lady: you look quite dapper in that shirt.
Me: queue internal debate about whether or not I‚Äôm gonna start banging grandmas
Just dont hate being in a 10m radius around me and i‚Äôll be happy for 7 lifetimes
I like your username, Op! You seem like a cool guy.
:(
I mean I‚Äôm a girl and I never get compliments. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs necessarily a gendered thing but maybe it is and I‚Äôm just really annoying lmao
Stop shitting me. You really fucked me up.
Literally if i have a shitty day and someone at school tells me, "Hey you look good today!" it would make my day so much better.
Hey, you guys reading this thread. You probably smell really nice and you're doing a great job out there. I'm proud of you.
If you‚Äôre reading this: you‚Äôre nice üòä
I always spend way too much on my shoes because it's the only complement I usually get. For all my boys out there, red Air Force 1's work like a charm.
So if I'm attracted to a guy (his brains, personality, and looks) and I give him regular compliments (not TOO many, I'm trying not to be creepy!) then I'm on the right track?

Like one day I might say "you look good in that shirt," another day might be "I loved the idea you added to that proposal; it was brilliant," and another day might be me being explicitly appreciative of something he's done for me ("you're the best, most people wouldn't have even noticed I needed help with that," etc.)

I'm not the worst looking woman out there, but certainly not the best, and I don't have a ton of confidence that I'm doing this right! Lol.
Guys need just as much snuggles as girls do, always being the instigator is  TIRING
the worst ones are when they make your write 3 "short" essays in an hour that are still 3-5 paragraphs long and they tell you to plan out your essay and spend 5 minutes thinking about it like nah, I'm gonna spend all 20 minutes to wrote whatever bs I can make up
My dad: 

Take your time when you take tests. If you rush it, you'll make mistakes.



*During the test*

Me: " ah this isn't that ba- "

Teacher: 2 MINUTES LEFT

Me: "Fuck... Im on question 5... Out of 10"
In my AP Lang class my teacher made us write in class essays everyday to get ready for the AP test, but EVERYTHING was completion and late points did not exist she was great. If you wanted to take the AP exam you took the essays seriously to practice writing an essay in an hour. If you didn‚Äôt you got a very easy AP credit. Very good teacher.
I had a high school teacher who used to make us write essays in 15 minutes. We‚Äôd do three in a row sometimes. That shit was drilled into us so hard that, even a decade later, I feel like I could slam out an essay at any time with no warning.
Really not like the simulations.
We have to write a full goddamn essay in 35 minutes THIRTY FIVE MINUTES:(
Must be finished by 59 minutes, they said.
AP test: write an essay in 35 minutes
[removed]
I had to write two essays in 80 minutes oof
Hypocrisy comes in many forms.
I always have so much fun writing essays. Highlight of my life. But algebra comes in and decides to take my joy, shatter it, and then give me a doctor-prescribed vibe check.
Must have 3 characters a plot and a climax.

It'll be easy they said.

Just work hard they said.
*Laughs in having unlimited time*
I once had an exam where we had to write 3 essays.
How about timed writings those things suck
Your essay must be three pages long, contain 7 paragraphs, two of which are the intro and conclusion, be written in 12 pt Times New Roman, and also its due tomorrow.
People have asked me how I can write an essay so fast. I tell them that I grab a few points, and spread it out in between paragraphs of descriptive fluff. The conclusion is a summary of your points and the introduction is your first point + some air bag idea you vaguely describe.

And there you have the test essay that could really have been 3 sentences long. Its so easy you'll actually have time to add useful information edit and proof read it.
Oh no
Our teachers say...

‚Äùby the time you get to that point you will be able to do it"

I spent at least four hours writing a history essay and I'm expected to write it in 50 minutes
Just like the simulations
Ap world history got me like
My hand would always hurt so bad by the 20 min mark
Not a teenager, but am teacher, for most standardized tests learn *how to* write an essay. They really don't grade the content of the essay, more of if you know how to write an essay.

*at least how standardized tests were back when I took them.

**standardized tests are more or less bullshit anyway.
*Confused screaming*
AP lang
they give you 1 hour? dang.. mine only got 50 min
My teacher has us do it in 40
Then you write an 4 page essay in 20 minutes
Cmon get him to 100,000 upvotes
"The exam has two parts, you will have two ours to complete it. Then we will use the next two ours to correct your final hand-ins... Study hard for next monday"
Schedule for the rest of the week...
Tuesday: oral exam
Wednesday: group exposition
Thursday: defense of last work
Friday: analysis of the movie we saw on class (in which you slept)

*ALL THE MAKE UPS ARE THE FOLLOWING WEEK*

"This is fine..." *cries internally*
Wait what teacher has ever said this

In pre-ap lit we often have to wright an essay in one period
I actually got stupidly good at writing B+/A essays in under 40 minutes
lol the sat is 50 minutes and my APUSH and APLAC essays are 30 minutes
Wait, that's illegal!
We have to write it in 20 to 40 mins tops.
In my country, we have in 8th grade a shitty shit exam which has grammar exercises, writting (imaginary )AND an essay. We have 1.5 hours to finnish the entire shit
1 hour? Its like 32 minutes with all the othe rbilahit to do on the test.
i mean ive gotta do that next english literature class soooo
For my grade 9 English exam, I had to write an essay in half an hour. I don't know how I did it.

He's **THE** absolute unit
Khan academy is great, easy to understand instructional videos and lots of material.

*heavy applause, whistling and roses thrown on stage*
I sold my soul to him the night before ap chem

He's single handedly saved the grades of all of us at some point
When my teachers are shit, he's what I use. what an absolute Chad
i'm honestly so glad i found him üò™
That guy has saved me so many times
God, a being of pure generosity
My school hates him. I praise him like a second Keanu Reeves
The savior of many failed tests
Only reason I passed math class
I applaud his work. It really is amazing. Not for me though. I despised it for whatever reason, but I still respect and admire how accessible he‚Äôs made education.

This guy has helped me so much. Massive respect for the guy.
*'Everybody loves Sal'*
I swear this dude has the butteriest voice of any math teacher ever.
Sal Khan helped me get into college. Don‚Äôt know where I would be about you and I‚Äôm happy that you chose to become an online teacher *gasps* midnight procrastination
there is a special place in heaven for this man. praise the creator of khan
This man made my homeschooling possible
KHAN!
Thank you for being there at 3 AM to teach me 1 month of lesson in 10 minutes. üôè
Literally my lifeline for some classes
I would give this guy the world
This man is god.
The *real* Sal
Sal khan is my daddy
Khan Academy saved my first semester of math from a B. Then, being the dumb shitter I am, I ignored my homework all of second semester and got a B...
Saul Khan Deez nuts
HELL YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He‚Äôs a real one
God bless him for saving us from the darkest time of learning
He somehow looks just like I imagined him from his voice.
Brown excellence strikes again
The Biggest Chad
He's the only reason I was able to pass Calc 2 with a B+, 4 years into college. Ty Sal
This man got me through integration, a feat I didn't think was possible.
Sal Kahn deez nuts
A real legend
His videos literally got me through high school.
Holy shit, this man saved my grades in algebra class many times over
Hmm...seeing all these upvotes and comments praising him kind of makes me feel bad how Khan Academy is the default study website resource for my school, yet I never took the time to use it. Sure puts emphasis on how lazy I am as a whole.
nothing but respect for my president
A lifesaver
I'm sorry, I hate Khan Academy. My teacher made us master multiple missions for a grade. Khan didn't help me, it was just time consuming homework to me. I don't hate Sal, I appreciate that he made this program, this is just my opinion on it. Congrats though, Sal. (We had to master 3 missions, I mastered the first two and did 90% on the last)
Ha! Graduated without it! 


Should have used it though...
when you karmafarm
#clap
I saw him once at a hotel restaurant.
We need a F not a clap!
He taught me how to animate but I didnt need it because I'm bad a drawing

I Highly highly respect this man, I really do. But fuck this guy
This man *was* my biology teacher
HE's help me learn so much. THank yOU
Basically my algerbra 2 teacher.
Sal and the Organic Chemistry Tutor saved me from failing math
I just did a post-grad certification program, and being able to re-learn all the math I never really understood back in highschool on Khan Academy was *invaluable*.  Thanks Sal Khan!

Well i was allowed to drink when i was 13 
Hi,
And welcome to Germany where noone gives a singel fuck 
:)
I think one of the basis for the higher age is that America is a lot more focused on individual vehicular transportation, especially with teenagers. If you have a high number of teenaged drivers and said teens are drinking you have high alcohol related car accidents. A lot of European people can just walk to the pub and drink and then walk back home.
Laughs in danish
Come to Belgium, best beer and you can but it when ur like 12 at a night shop without anyone giving a flying fuck, you could prolly get soms cigs with it.

THREE YEAR UPDATE: Okay, so I totally forgot about this and I don‚Äôt even use Reddit anymore, but here‚Äôs the update! I‚Äôm in college now, I‚Äôve changed my major twice, but now I‚Äôm set with electrical engineering. I have an emperor scorpion that I named Oscilloscorp in honor of my decision. I highly regret not taking school much more seriously than I did in the beginning because now I have zero freedoms in my classes (free electives used up from old major). I‚Äôm a recovering league addict, but that‚Äôs only so that I can focus on my schoolwork. I‚Äôm a hell of a lot more productive; straight As look extremely doable for me this semester. Life is pretty fuckin great tbh.
Im going to be starting my first year of college at this time. Sup Freshman, college sucks doesn't it?

For everyone asking, no one was hurt. The school was Peebles High School, if you don‚Äôt believe me look it up, reverse image search, anything. You won‚Äôt find the image anywhere, it‚Äôs a real post. The roof caved in, destroying art and the old PE building, some languages classrooms were damaged and the school is closed for the ‚Äòforeseeable future‚Äô

Update: School is cancelled till Christmas

Update: New info has been released and two kids have been arrested for stacking gym mats and then setting them alight. No ‚Äòart kilns‚Äô exploded, that was a cover.

Eh, it's just another training

Last year there was a malfunctioning smoke detector in the kitchen, and we ended up having to have the fire department come to the school 6 times in 1 week, yes there was one day it happened twice. the reason they came was because there was a thing that called the fire department automatically. and we couldn't go back to class till they came and cleared they building.
omg finally im so excited for you!

Not antimask, just want to say this is a bad argument. The meme words it like if everyone wore the mask the virus would just disappear, which is not true. Even if literally everyone wore a mask the virus would still be around, just the number of infections would be considerably lower
Meanwhile in Germany we've been wearing masks since April and we got about as many daily deaths as the USA right now, despite being in a lockdown since November 1st. Masks may help, but they don't stop the virus.
Thanks for the reminder that you still have no idea what this is all about.
Yes, because covid is still infecting people because some idiots didn't wear a mask. That's not how any of this works.
Just put some text saying that the wearer hates masks and you

1. Get profit from anti-maskers
2. Get people to wear masks

Easy!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Or, you could just *dispose of* the anti-maskers instead, so we all wear masks.
Im not an anti masker but if everyone wore a mask coronavirus wouldn't just disappear. The reason the virus is still around is because not everyone has been vaccinated or had the disease.
Bro if everyone is touching and going about their business without having any distance between each other the masks will do nothing. If you don't clean them daily and not wash your hands before touching it it makes it useless. People are so fucking dumb they think like "oh I have my mask so I am ok now let's go and touch seventy different things on my way home without any actual reason, I am wearing a mask and that's all that matters" .
Op is a bot
It was never going to go away regardless of how compliant people were. That's not what happens with viruses most of the time. Take the flu for example.
I love being in an abusive relationship with my government. Yes daddy tell me I can‚Äôt work anymore or see my friends  and tell me it‚Äôs my fault uwu
I hate that the whole mask thing just turned into virtue shaming.
Just to let you know we ain't going to get rid of the virus, it will simply mutate and you will simply have to get a new vaccine every year. Even flu mutates and we create new vaccines almost every new year for that reason. As humanity the diseases we have eradicated can be counted with the fingers of one of your hands...
Bruh as if covid is gonna completely go away
Sounds like fascism to me
1. Viruses don't keep track of years. 
2. Wearing a mask isn't going to get rid of the virus.
I literally went to r/NoNewNormal and it was completeley bonkers over there. Like seriously, if you all want, check them out. Woooooooooo.
Why is it so hard to put the mask on? ü§® Just put it on your face for the sake of everyone's safety and health
Dumb meme
Why is the frame on the right dirty
Even if i think its funny I must say even if everyone last year would have been wearing a mask we still wouldn't get rid of it, and the virus will probably be here for the next years too because its impossible to get rid of it of such a thing in that little time, and the vaccines won't change anything either, at least for the next 2 years because we don't have the capacities fot it
Covid-19 would last longer than a year regardless if everyone wore a mask.

The protesting most likely had something to due with Covid-19 spreading aswell. You know, large groups of people all together.

I highly doubt Covid-19 would‚Äôve been gone even if everyone social distanced, and wore a mask.

The Spanish Flu for example, people wore masks and social distanced but it lasted for about a three years.

I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear a mask.‚Äù i‚Äôm just saying there are many reason Covid-19 is very much still a thing
Another reminder..

WEAR IT OVER YOUR NOSE!!!

Seriously I see *wayyyy* too many kids my age doing this and you really don‚Äôt look cool or anything. You just look like an idiot who doesn‚Äôt realize that they breathe through their nose :/
COVID won't just dissapear like that, there will be always infections and spikes without vaccination.
All you Americans act like masks are an inpenetrable barrier that blocks all viruses from coming in and out.

Just no. There is no country with mask mandates that has reduced the spread. None. Only thing that works is social distancing... and lockdowns, until you open up again. 

The mask has become some sort of wierd political bat against the covidiots in America. It wont help against the virus, nor will it help against idiots.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs not just the mask. There are many variables in play
I hate this sub Reddit, my generation is fucking stupid
Even with having to wear these suckers the numbers are still not going down. Those few not wearing these things are the reason for that? Yeah, right.
Jokes on you. The virus mutated and is more contagious now thanks to over-sanitation and allopatric speciation!
Well I mean wearing them wouldn‚Äôt have somehow magically eliminated the virus. 

Please don‚Äôt walk around in a mask thinking that it‚Äôs going to prevent you from spreading or catching the virus. 

If you are sick get tested and self isolate until you have the all clear. Don‚Äôt go out in a mask, that‚Äôs not going to suddenly make you healthy, your geeky at and the mask won‚Äôt contain all of your germs and as soon as the mask gets wet you‚Äôll be shedding the virus all over the place. 

If you don‚Äôt want to catch the virus limit your exposure to other people as much as possible and practice good hand hygiene.
Masks slow the spread not stop it.
That‚Äôs not how it works At all
Bullshit
sure billions of dollar that went into researching vaccine are inconsequential. we should have just wore a mask to get rid of virus in 2020. common sense is sure in short supply among snowflakes.
Yeah, just a reminder.

2020: You have to wear this due to political concerns over a virus even through [the CDC still doesn't recommend masks to healthcare providers](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/understanddifferenceinfographic-508.pdf), [a mask is NOT a substitute for social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html), and you are at best demonizing people over a [5% reduction](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/aiop-mne122120.php).

2021: You still have to wear it. Because if you're stupid enough you may think healthcare is magic and diseases vanish overnight. Then when you find out that didn't work , you're also part of the same group that'll believe any far fetched bullshit reason it didn't.

Like here is a good one. "*It's all Papa's fault. How dare he pretend to fail [the fitness](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA) test that [OSHA requires for n95s](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1996-03-04-0) that doesn't matter to my anti-union stance. He obviously is lying because I can breath through my almost completely useless mask and that means he should too.*" Remember to project your life experience on everyone and hate them for not being like you. It helps to ostracize you even further from reality and turns you into a reliable voter &amp; consumer.

Or you know, you can accept the reality the government is always going to claim there is another new disease around the corner and they just don't really vanish until well after a vaccine is capable of dealing with it is handed out on a global level.

Jokes on you 

I dont go outside because the British government said and if i go outside ill get a fine

Edit: if you go outside for a unspecified reason you could get a fine from the police
I doubt if everyone wore it it would completely eradicate the virus, it would be much better though
I like wearing a mask
NOOOOOO NOT THAT MASK, I CAN FEEL IT TAKING MY FREEDOM AWAY FROM ME LIKE DEMENTORS
That‚Äôs not how it works...
No matter how many masks people wear or how much social distancing they do, we‚Äôre never going to get our freedom back until the vaccine has been rolled out and herd immunity has been achieved. 
Anti-vaxxers are going to be the problem
I hope that people, who don't wear mask in public, get cold knees üòî
A piece of cloth over my face isn‚Äôt gonna stop a fucking virus
Yeah that's teenager logic. Because masks didn't stop the virus from spreading in any of the countries it was made mandatory. Every single country that mandated masks still experienced a second wave, most of which long after masks were mandated. Believing that masks are a magic pill that will stop the virus is pretty dumb.

We wouldn't have gotten rid of it by now if people wore masks anyway.

I've wiped my screen 3 times.
Unfortunately my job had so many cases and refused to shut down I had gotten in working in manufacturing with a mask and all it was just to many people they wouldn't tell us which shift had it or anything so I caught it as well as my wife and daughter Christmas definitely sucked. But we survived and all just wish people took things more serious instead of constantly fighting the mask.
We wouldn‚Äôt be rid of it either way don‚Äôt kid yourself
the virus still being present has nothing to do with people not wearing  
the mask, maybe there are more people getting infected, but it would still be around because people throw parties
All the people celebrating the end of 2020 on NYE to get rid of the ‚Äúshit year‚Äù made me lol because this is also going to be a shit year because of dumb fucks like them

Someone fucking spoiled it on a Minecraft server today. *The biggest Minecraft server in the world*
A punk-ass Corporal did this to us, but with Star Wars: The Force Awakens. We were in Recruit Training during it's release and when he threatened to "Spoil the juiciest bits if we were whispering or falling asleep" I thought it was hilarious because

 1) I had read about NCO's and DI's doing this type of thing before joining. 

 2) It was incredibly effective. Everyone was paying attention to an incredibly boring CBRN class. 

It only sucked that he spoiled it at the end of his class for us anyway. Some people get off on ruining things for others. You could tell that he just wanted his little power trip over some recruits. I admittedly fell into some of the same dickbaggery when it was my turn.

This means the smart girls with straight A‚Äôs who barely talk have more power than ever now
Endgame is actually 3 hours of thanos teaching agriculture to the viewer. We left off on a cliffhanger where he was about to efficiently cultivate a field of parsley and potatoes, all while managing a massive number of high status connections across the town. The result being able to buy large shipments of rutabaga seed at a whopping 90 percent discount (almost beating out the profit margin of the legendary schrute farms). The sequel, Avengers: this is not a game, will release in August of 2020 and will be a 65 hour long  psa on the environmental impact that small cats have on global climate change, all while wrapping up the remaining plot threads of endgame. Also tony becomes president and at the end of his two very efficient terms he is able to lower the rate of all std‚Äôs by a record breaking 58.3 percent, and is able to cut the U.S‚Äôs inefficient military funding and redirect it towards a plethora of different causes, most notably spreading awareness and ease of care regarding mental health in America.

I just saw endgame, and it was pretty good, but there were a few weird things.

I thought it was strange how the Russo Brothers decided to render Thanos‚Äô erect penis in such vivid detail. The veins were so perfectly done I couldn‚Äôt even tell his cock wasn‚Äôt real.

Another thing I found weird was when Black Panther broke the fourth wall and gave the audience the n-word pass. I did appreciate it, but it would feel more in place in a Deadpool movie.

Overall, it was still excellent, but I think that they definitely need to reconsider some things.

At our school today everyone was so heated over endgame spoilers that we had groups of guys in every room that had seen the movie already that made sure no spoilers got stated.

I still do this with my parents
Me at 15 years old
i had a lil cousin that would sit and cry when he sees his mom sleep . crying "please dont die" .
I would recognize this episode interactive background anywhere
so my parents went out to do some errands and they said they would get pizza and be home at 8. it was around 8:30 and i started getting nervous bc their phones were dead (i don‚Äôt know) and they weren‚Äôt answering. so my brain decided to convince myself that they died in a car crash so i had a panic attack and started crying and went to my neighbors, and he said they would be fine (he‚Äôs around my age(i‚Äôm 14 and he‚Äôs 16)).  i went back to my house and my parents were there and they said the line was long. so i ate pizza and cried. and this was all bc the line at the pizza place was long.
Me at 17 imagining scenarios in my head making me worry more
I'm 14, I still do this.

Although, I have extreme anxiety, so maybe it isn't all that surprising.
[deleted]
You just described my life perfectly. Even now, if they take too long coming home I instantly think of the worst-case scenario.

To add to it, my dad got into a wreck last year that didn't hurt him other than lots of bruises, but if he had turned one second later he would be dead.
Me at 6 but its both my parents
Both of my parents have gotten into pretty serious accidents whilst making a grocery run or driving to a school event and it freaks me the fuck out
5 yro me: Guess I need a job now
Oh my god yesss!! Finally a meme i can relate
My mom was a nurse and she always came home late, but sometimes she would stay later than usual since she was a nurse but I always sat there crying because I thought something happened to her. My dad, who worked until 9 at the time, had to comfort me and remind me that she was a nurse. A lot.
So I'm not the only one. I'd spend my time walking around aimlessly in front of our door, casually looking at the security camera to see if her car arrived. I was 12 back in the day, I'd turn the TV on to feel less alone. Nickelodeon was great, back in the day.
Still me when my mom doesn‚Äôt answer my texts
Showed this to my mom and she laughed :) this meme is mom approved
Ikr my dad's taken years to come back!
Then she eventually comes home and when you ask why she was so late, she said she met one of her friends and started doing the "I'm only gonna talk for 5 minutes" but ends up talking for an hour things and you are sad and mad at the same time because you were so worried that you give her a major telling off and shout at her to go to her room. Then she actually does it because she feels really bad for making you worry. That makes you feel more guilty and then you end up crying yourself to sleep. 

Tru story tho.
That's me at any age
once i was more worried than all the other times, partially because my grammas kind of an idiot. 

Cast: me &amp; my cousin M (1 year older than me) my uncle D (not the cousins' dad), my gramma, my younger brothers and younger cousins (not really important) my aunt T (not cousins kids or uncle D's wife)

So, earlier that day, we went somewhere for like a birthday party and afterwards we went to my grammas house. uncle D went to take a nap because he was tired, and we were playing board games or bingo or play fighting or whatever tf we were doing. then at like 5:30 my gramma said that she was gonna get food or go out or whatever and she asked if they wanted to go. My cousins and and brothers said yes, but my and my other cousin said that were fine.

So me and my cousin were playing video games for a long time, along with other stuff, and at like 9 we were getting really hungry, but we were like whatever, at like 9:15 or 9:30 we woke up uncle D and were like were hungry and explained the whole story. He then called my gramma and got us some grapes or something. My gramma wouldn't pick up for a while and we got worried. 

He then called aunt T and was like can you put mom (our gramma) on the phone. she said ok and did. Uncle D was like, are you going to make anything for OP and M and my gramma was like but they said they werent hungry and my uncle had to explain that that was 4 hours ago.

Well thats just my story 

tldr: gramma leaves me and my cousin at home for 4 hours
Yo this meme is stolen it was posted a day ago on Twitter with this exact picture and text
Holy shit I thought I was the only one
When I was 11 my parents woke me and my brother out of bed around 9 pm and put us in the car. Dad drove a different car and we rode with our stepmom. We drove for what seemed like 2 hours. I asked many times where we were going but my stepmom just told me to be quiet. I guess she just thought I was being an annoying and nosy kid. I silently cried in the back seat for the rest of the trip because I was sure that she was going to ditch us in the the car somewhere and ride back with my dad. Why couldn't she have just told me they were selling the car?
u/repostsleuthbot
I blame kid's movies. Every kid's parents were dead. 

Even cartoons
I waited an hour for what should have been a ten minute drive for my mom. She wouldn't respond back to any of my texts or calls and I was starting to get worried, apparently she had been pulled over because the police were looking for someone driving the same model car as my mom's and kept her there for a while, especially because one of her friends smoked a joint before riding in her car the day before and kept asking her why the car smelled of marijuana.
I wonder where they are.. 
Huh this is longer than usual.. 
hm..  maybe traffic? 
oh god it's been and our are they ok?? 
oh no..  maybe their car crashed.. 
maybe they got stopped by a murderer
maybe they got killed.... 
oh jeez who will be at the funeral..?

You have a pretty dope room for a 9 year old
I was always paranoid about my parents leaving to go somewhere, so my dad sat me down and tells me ‚ÄúI will always return home no matter what happens I will return, so if we take longer that usual you just sit tight... unless of course i die, dead people don‚Äôt return home you know..‚Äù And just remember thinking like that‚Äôs exactly what i fear, but i did not tell him.
I still do that
My mom takes longer than usual and then I start thinking about me and my dad's future without her.
Me at 15 still I worry
Not gonna lie, I still get that. Before my parents leave to go anywhere I always ask them when they‚Äôd be getting back, and if that time is beyond 30 minutes, I‚Äôll start getting stressed and, as the meme states, start thinking up the possibility that they had died. I‚Äôm fucking 17 goddamnit.... shouldn‚Äôt be like this.
When I was 14 y/o my mom and my grandmother didnt come back from a supper with some friends as planned at 12pm. Like the person I am I still watched anime till 3am or so and did notice they did not comeback. 

The following day I learned my great grandmother died after a supper with my cousin on her couch like ~1km away from where I lived. The moment I asked my mother why she did come back this late (like at 8am or so, I only saw her in the afternoon) must be one of the hardest moment I felt in my life. 

Tbh I definitly wasnt prepared for this answer...
When mom always comes home while you're watching your favorite show, but this time the show is over and you realize she isn't home.
Am I the only adult who still feels the same way with their parents?
Or cheating on your dad
When my brother would be running late from getting home from school running late i would ask my grandma, what if he got into a crash.

My parents took away my laptop, so I missed online class. The teacher called them and now they blame me for it. (That happened before the Easter holidays)
My parents do this for A-'s, it kills me. You got an upvote from my PTSD
[deleted]
I see no point in taking away things they love if they are genuinely trying. But if they are basicly ignoring work to play games, or do stuff they like and that's why they have bad grades, then I would set up rules like "you can have (whatever thing they like) once you do your homework"
Yup I was doing shit in school because I didn't have a laptop so I bought a Chromebook and literally 5 days after I got it she returned it back to the store because my grades were bad so I couldn't do my work to bring my grades up to get a computer. 
That my friends is a catch 22
straight A with occasional B gang?
my Parents give me a chance to fix my grades they don‚Äôt like C and below
I currently am grounded but at night I am able to sneak my phone to my room at night and I can. Use it for like an hour before I fall asleep and forget to put it back.
My parents say they dont care about my grade just if i try my best

Me tries my best on a test but fails:

My parents: &gt;:( why did you fail! You are grounded! (Or they take away my electronics)
my friends mom grounded him for the rest of quarantine and hes not allowed on technology. he doesnt even know why
even better: "my daughter has been straight A's her entire life, never been suspended, got into an extremely difficult program for high school, and doesn't do anything illegal. hmmm maybe i should take away her phone and not allow her to go out with friends"
Its them damn video games.
Maybe if I make him less happy, he will be motivated to try harder!
getting 60% when the average is 24%:

you shouldn't compare yourself to other students.

getting 90% when the average is 95%:

rage.
im really glad i have parents that are understanding because they have never done anything like this. If i do something wrong there is consequences of course but they have never done anything this bad.
Yeah, I relate to this, but it also happens that I'm the king of great deals on eBay.

My parents took away my phone: I bought a Huawei P10 for 60$ on eBay

My parents took away my PlayStation: I got an Xbox One from a pawn shop for 80$

I have so many electronics that my parents don't know about and I'll never tell them because I'll end up without them.
If this happens to you does it motivate you or just make you less motivated because you have nothing to look forward to?
Because that's the way I am.
I once got a B+ on a bio exam and my parents legit locked me out of my house.
my mom literally doesn't allow me to work on an essay becauseim "such a nerd, stop doing relativity"
I literally have A- in every subject and I‚Äôm ahead from the whole class in edguenity my parents still won‚Äôt let me play csgo 

They say one hour a day of gaming is a lot even if you did all your work  

WTF
[removed]
then if it continues you get smacked until you learn how to hide your grade.

Dude parents just have no IQ when it comes to punishments, my parents are threatening to take my door off if I have trash in my room or if my room isn‚Äôt clean
Bruh I wanna show my parents this but they won‚Äôt like it
Luckily my parents don't do this. Their mentality is to treat me like I'm grown and if I fail it's my problem not theirs. More parents need to do this so we can grow up with some damn self responsibility.
I have a B average. If I get an A, they tell me good job, if I get a C or below, they imply that I am too caught up in games and have my head up my ass instead of focusing on my school work. Keep in mind I am taking AP Bio, Calculus, Civics, a early college course, Modern Greek (which is grammar for Ancient Greek), and advanced English.
[deleted]
See I got very high grades through elementary and middle. I got to high school and failed two classes. Lowered standards. Now I‚Äôm doing well, average, but I really do try my best.
Yeah I don‚Äôt really get it, I‚Äôm taking 7 internationally based college level classes, which is the hardest option in my county, and I take jrotc for the last class and I‚Äôm the cadet Corp commander for that. I get As and Bs always. I‚Äôm a student pilot. I‚Äôm a student EMT. And I got accepted into the firefighting class for next year which my high school only allows five slots for. But noooo! You can‚Äôt relax, you have to always be doing something!
Ah yes. Democracy.
Punishment needs to match the crime. If I did something really stupid and got my DS taken away, then I deserved it. A bad grade isn't the end of the world and taking things away likely won't help the kid find the motivation to do better. When kids (or people in general) don't do good work, or *won't* do work, there is usually some underlying issue that is stopping them from completing everything on time and well. Try to fix that issue, and the problem of grades becomes much easier to solve.
I feel bad for everyone else. My parents are the owners and founders of a decently large company for kids, so they know how to be with kids really well. This has never happened to me
I have only done poorly for one quarter and they threatened to take away my things so I brought it up a bit. I feel like threatening is a lot more effective than doing it immediately, because you still have the things but you realize you won‚Äôt if they take it away so you actually try to keep it
I hope this isn't rude, but..you people have got some awful parents if they do this crap to you over grades.
I can get the parent's thinking but I also think it's false. "The child isn't doing well, the video games distract him constantly, that must mean that the video games are responsible!". I think it's false because that's not the only reason why. Maybe both are a result of the same different cause? Maybe it's just coexistent? Maybe they aren't related whatsoever?
I feel like if a kid‚Äôs spending all of their time play games rather than doin their work or studying, then it‚Äôs ok to do that. But if they are actually trying, then no it isn‚Äôt ok
Fucks took away my games for 6 months
This can be an effective method if you do it right, and utterly horrible it you don't. The right way to do it is:

- to talk to your child about the behavior you want changed, including why you want it changed. 
- then you listen to their side of the story, so they feel like they have a chance to explain
- if you don't like the explanation or don't think it warrants an exception, you tell them what you expect, and say they will get 2 warnings.  On the 3rd time you will (insert punishment here)
- you warn them the appropriate number of times, reminding them of how many they have left
- you tell hmm you don't want to (punishment), but that they must obey the rules
- after the 3rd time, you do (punishment), reminding them that you've of them up front and warned them multiple times

Caveat - punishment shouldn't be taking their phone away for a week/month.  One day should do the trick, and will hopefully prove your point that you are capable of doing that again if the behavior isn't better.

The fear of losing their phone for a longer time should give them incentive to try harder.
Man this makes me appreciate my parents even more, despite their shortcomings on being rational on some very serious topics. They have absolutely never compared me to someone else. Always said to just get good marks.
I didn't get a single B throughout the entirety of elementary school. Now my parents use that as a basis for how they feel about me. I know middle school is easy as hell compared to highschool, but of course I'm going to do worse in middle school than elementary. All I did in elementary was shove crayons up my nose and laugh at the ugly animals in the nature documentaries.
I‚Äôm experiencing it right now and I just went onto reddit to forget about it.
I haven't because my parents aren't assholes
I have never experienced this actually, guess I‚Äôm lucky
I have crippling depression and video games are the only things that really help to distract me from the constant suffering. when I'm not gaming, all i can do is sit down and think, which always leads to an existential crisis. my parents like to take away my games when my grades go down.

"I didn't take an exam while I BIRTHED YOU for you to not turn in your homework! We work hard in this family!"
This is a picture of a human that has aged 16 years from6 months ago. Poor homie :/
I took an exam after my water broke, only when I finished the exam drove to the hospital and gave birth
Priorities, people
My mom took a mid term in a senior level petroleum engineering class while she was in labor with me. Scored 5 points over the average. 

I‚Äôm 35 and do, indeed, still hear about it.
What college wouldnt count that ad a medical exception? At the college I went too we let a student take their exam 3 months after the entire class cause they were having issues
Ten years ago, I went back to college.  I shared many classes with "Virahi" (not her real name), a woman from India who had recently married.  She was 23/24, and was *ecstatic* when she became pregnant.  She gave birth mid semester.  Her husband, parents, and in-laws came to the school to get her work an her exams.  She took two finals in the hospital a few days after giving birth to her son.   When she was out, our professors let her make up the labs. Her parents (or in-laws, can't remember) sat out in the hall with the baby, showing him off to our professors and classmates, despite the language barrier. She aced all of it.  She was a machine.  I still think about her and hope she is doing well.
Still there is time kid ... Just wrap the wires around your neck
She probably could have just gotten an excused absence for this.
YOUUU think school Is hard now I had to take a test right after giving birth
I have a goddamn veterinarian exam tomorrow!
when is it my turn to repost this?
This is so messed up... the professor couldn't give her a makeup date?!
Imagine studying before an exam
It's 3am
She's still studying but she has the notebook in her arms, is writing on the baby with a straw and the pen is in the coffee mug
Is this woman a teenager? She looks around 40 years old.

I note, because this is r/teenagers.
what an absolute badass,
My dad spent the night with my mom giving  birth and the morning he was at his exam looking horrible his teacher told wtf are you doing here go back with your wife and kid you will pass the exam next week. 

I had a teacher send home a pregnant woman that was 1week late to give birth. He didn't want her to start labor in an exam! Guess what? She went into labor an hour after the exam started lol. He let her take the exam a month later so she had at least some sleep. 

I think every single of my teachers have a story about a pregnant student lol universities are great for that all the teachers gave their students the exam at least one-two weeks after the gave birth. 

I am surprised about this picture! Her teacher most be a big asshole
This is pretty serious tho.PPL are trying to finish school with their baby.Give then ur support.and I bet u no teen
I remember that time my cousin had the final exam the very next day after burying his mother
Having just given birth 24 days ago, I could not have that. Mad props to that mama!!
Took my baby to anatomy final.  Baby bjorn, formaldehyde, and cadaver.  I‚Äôm so sorry bb.
This is what being American feels like someones lol
In this life, you must be hard working. Remember that time I gave birth to you, I was studying after labour. Nothing stopped me from studying even you.
My mother was in the final year of medical school when she had my eldest brother. Imagine being the most stressed in your life and still having a baby. Anyways she's been a doctor for 20+ yrs now and my brother has yet to hear such a thing. 

Kids, if your parents truly love you, they will never scold you for something like this.
My mom did this (for her masters tho). But she never held it on me. It only comes up when talk about my childhood. I‚Äôm proud you mom ü§©ü•∞

FYI: She was the topper
Lotsa people in this thread making jokes, arguing about exam time frames and exemptions... But very few (if any) comments recognize this woman.

Like, holy shit. She just gave birth and she's *studying.* 

That's major bodily trauma on top of cuddling/nursing a newborn, while *still in the hospital.*

She is a force to be reckoned with, wherever she is.
Worst case scenario, you have to do homework WHILE giving birth
Are you a teenager?
She do be havin poppies chicken tho
I think that woman deserves to make that exam later, all in all i admire her for this.
Im pretty sure they‚Äôd make an exception for you and would of let you rescheduled that test....
why not just defer the exam...
That‚Äôs fucked, she can‚Äôt get her exam date pushed even if she pushed a literal child out of her body the day before? That‚Äôs certainly a valid excuse
Every year on the baby‚Äôs birthday, the story will be told again
I‚Äôm already annoyed for the baby
Poor baby
After I gace birth I was incredibly tired, it's not a normal tired of being awake all night it's a different intense kinda tired, i have no idea how this woman managed to do this.

Mad respect for her.

I remind my oldest daughter how after months of waiting she decided to come out when I finally got into a 10th prestige lobby in MW2. I managed to delay the birth long enough to make it to 6th prestige then had to get her to hospital ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This picture reminds me of my sister! Story time! 

My sister got pregnant at 20 and gave birth at 21 while still in undergrad. With no help from the dad, she got accepted and pursued a legal degree at the University of Puerto Rico. With very limited money and help, she pushed on.

In law school she was known for bringing her baby to class each day and studying in the library with him. Classmates would often find her sleeping in cafeteria and offer to take her son for a while and buy her food.

One day, a new librarian told her she couldn't bring a baby in, my sister - a very sassy latina - jokingly sighed in relief, thanked the librarian for offering help, and handed her the baby and the bag and told her she'd be back in a few hours. The librarian never tried stopping her again.

During lectures, professors would jokingly call on her son for answers when nobody was paying attention, endearing him to the faculty and the rest of the students.

With limited resources (no help from dad), she pushed on. Eventually, the stress of studying for the bar exam put my sister in the hospital with pneumonia. However, even with pneumonia, she still took the exam and passed.

For her graduation, the faculty made her son his own cap and gown and they got to walk across the stage together. A picture of them walking across the stage together (he was 3 by then) made headlines throughout Puerto Rico. 

My sister would go on to be one of Puerto Rico's most prominent family practice and appeals lawyers. 

25 years later, her son Alejandro, would walk across the same stage. The same faculty that helped her, now saw him do the same. It was beautiful.

Although she got to see him graduate from law school and pass the bar, sadly, she passed away before he was sworn in. He has since taken the mantel of her practice and continues to work on the same issues she fought for.

Last year, the University of Puerto Rico's law school held a memorial in her honor. It was there that they announced that they would be renaming the family practice department after my sister.

Her name was Rosa, I miss her so very, very much. 

Good luck kid, you have a wonderful mother.
I just gave birth and my baby almost ripped my CLIT off in the process. I promise you she is going to get sick of that story. üòÇ
Child: * slacks in any way *

Parent: DID YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS YOUNGER--
Kinda makes me feel bad for the kid. You just gave birth to him and you can't focus on him for a few minutes? Why the hell did you have a kid?
Another great lesson in priorities.
My mom could eat and drink during her exams, because of me
Supermom
I‚Äôm just trying to imagine this situation:
Guy: Hey, I think your voice is really cute

Her: wait until you hear me moan

Guy: ... Gimme a second, I gotta ask Reddit how to respond to that
Just ask her out and if she says no then 
1.accept it like a crazy person

2. Flee the country and change your name (preferbly live in isolation maybe on a high moutain)
Whoa premarital casual conversation, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
You flirt back confidently, just fake confidence dude, it works
It‚Äôs either:
1. She likes you back
2. She knows you have a crush on her and she‚Äôs teasing you 
3. A freaky coincidence
That‚Äôs hot
Good job dude
Make her moan
these posts are making me jealous af
\&gt;what do I do

make her moan, duh
I have not programmed that path yet.

Edit: woah this is my first 1k.
Respond with "I bet I moan better"
There is 2 outcome in this situation:
She likes you, and naughty things going to happen.
She need you to check her porn vid, if its good to share with her boyfriend
Don‚Äôt fall for the earthly desires brother, sex is temporary, but crusade is forever.

[Edit] By the Lord! I did not expect my humble preaching to attract a crowd of such brave and holy warriors. Today is a good day, but tomorrow we shall find out. Ready your armour and sharpen your blades, we leave at sunrise!
Make her moan bro idk what else to say
Sir you‚Äôve *won*
I'd probably say "Let's see about that."
Op i demand you to update how your relationship going
"You did it! You crazy son of a bitch! You did it!"
.... went to 0 to 100 real ....... quick
"I wouldn't mind to hear you moan, would you?"
Que the pornhub intro*
"Dear diary: jackpot"
Moan next time you see her; best mating call out there

She moans back, then you're good to go
Um, any context?
She said "until" and not "if". Get her bud. She wants you. Ask her out and things will fall into place and you will hear her moan in no time.
Moan back to assert dominance
The Implications are clear
Did she wink after she said it?
You should say - let me hear it then
Good man.
You guys talk to your crushes?
This is definitely going to my saved posts. This is too good to forget...

Get her, OP
Rub the clitoral area like you're a DJ at a scratch contest.
Say ‚Äúand what does that sound like‚Äù
You did it woah!
Well dayum
It's weird when other people have actual relationships with their crush, and not just a vague friendship like I do
Nice
Nothing is more true
Even just reading this is making me mad lol I hate when my mom does that
Nah, she expects you to be there in 2 sec when your name is called out.
I'm laughing but dying inside
This is true knowledge
My mom once told me it was because when she yells my name she expects me to come to the kitchen.
that's a pretty og twitter handle
all i want is an explanation as to why they do this
*inhales*


YEAH ILL BE RIGHT THERE MUM
Im gonna tell yall a secret. She hears you. Every time. She just wants you to come where she is.
OK so random question
Is there a subreddit where I can post random shit without it getting deleted for it being 'unrelated to the subreddit'?
I shout down and then nothing happens. Then a few minutes later she shouts again and says that my food's getting cold.
So trueeee! I mean. How can it be so trueeee!?!?!
As a parent I‚Äôve actually figured this one out. I can hear my child mumbling under her breath because she tends to be more worked up and huffy thus for actually mumbling louder then she intends to but when I call for her or something from another she is more relaxed and not worked up thus for speaking softer. 

Makes sense though right? You tend to speak louder and higher when you annoyed or mad  verse when you calm cool and relaxing
We all can. On the other side, I can yell to my son to set the table three or four times and he won't listen. Open a bag of chips and he will magically appear.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that
Thats because they expect YOU to come down or come out to the kitchen after the first call.
Say yes one more mf time
This touched my soul
Cuz some people only hear what they wanna hear and not what they don't.
The truth, the truth everywhere
Do you think moms pretend not to hear you so you actually go there?
Nah my mom is a fraud. She says "what did you say?" whenever she expects me to say something under my breath, sometimes she just gets lucky.
Mom‚Äôs do that because we want you to come to us. If we followed up with a question or directions most likely you would want something repeated since it‚Äôs being yelled across the house. So anyways, just send mom a text or go see what she needs!
Nah she heard you but she wants you to get up and come to her. Then she wanna be slick and say "will you get my purse for me" HELL NAH ITS 2 FEET AWAY FROM YOU LAZY ASS I mean yeah mom I got it.
Hm, it‚Äôs not always a respect thing however and I think it‚Äôs unfair to treat it as such. 

It‚Äôs not like (all) teenagers are expecting mummy to have a full fledged conversation from across the house. Because I don‚Äôt know about you, but in my world, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù means ‚ÄúPlease repeat yourself, I didn‚Äôt hear you‚Äù, with a lot less syllables.

I have poor hearing (didn‚Äôt know at the time because who needs to look further into an issue when you can blame it on dIsReSpEcT!) and would have the door shut, music or a video playing, or even just be engrossed in a book or school work. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt even hear her with the door OPEN. My mother would call from the living room, clear on the other side of the house from my bedroom. I would call out ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt know if I actually heard her or not. Instead of calling for me again, she would wait. And wait. Ignoring me as I shouted, ‚ÄúDid you call me?‚Äù 

Now it wasn‚Äôt an issue of her not hearing me- woman could hear me clearly in my room. The walls are actually kind of thin. But instead of calling my name again (one syllable! Four letters!) she would ignore me. After a bit I would assume she hadn‚Äôt called me because clearly if she had, she would answer. 

As to why I didn‚Äôt just come out and check, If I came out because I thought I heard her calling me, but she hadn‚Äôt, she‚Äôd complain and roll her eyes. 

It is a catch 22 for the teen and it‚Äôs unfair. 

Because she was frustrated and felt disrespected, she ignored and spited her child and berated him for a medical condition she ignored. Again because she felt disrespected. Because I felt trapped in a position with no solution, I began to resent the double bind. 

Boiling all teen and parent interactions down to respect-disrespect removes the nuance and fosters inherent confirmation bias. If she had asked herself, me, or the doctor why I couldn‚Äôt hear her, or if she had just called again when asked, then we wouldn‚Äôt have had as many issues. If she hadn‚Äôt discouraged coming out to check if she needed me whenever I *thought* I heard her call, I would have come out more often on the first call because I thought I heard her faintly. 

Teens can be disrespectful. It comes with the undeveloped brain and lack of emotional stability and lots of stress, more than they experienced in their short life. An attempt to see both sides helps resolve just about any conflict, and while a teen might not always have the forethought or insight to understand their parents, as the adults, it is the parents‚Äô responsibility to do so. In doing that, they lead by example and their children learn as well. 

TLDR - parents need to stop equating immediate obedience to respect. Teens need to learn perspective on their own stress and their parents‚Äô.
People hear what they want to hear,so say what they want to hear
Yeah what‚Äôs with that
how do i send this to my mom without sending this to my mom
me: Yeahh??

Still no fucking replies. I'm frustrated.
Respond with "whatever" when ur mom calls.. problem solved
Being a mother my self,  I am still laughing at that one!!! Thank you so much for that!!
They developed this type of hearing called I only here shit I wanna hear.
It is very true. It's partly because we don't actually hear you say whatever. We hear a grumpy little mumble and assume you say 'whatever'. Find a word that's same syllables and similar sounds and say that under your breath instead. Then you can say you didn't say it.
She hears you, just wants you to show up in person. Which I‚Äôve come to realize is what they think repeatedly calling your name means when you scream ‚ÄúYEAH‚Äù. Bottom line if you scream ‚ÄúYEAH‚Äù and their response is to keep calling your name, they want you there in person.
She can hear you, she will ignore you so you will come
My parents developed an effective strategy which was to bang on the upstairs hallway wall when they wanted me

It was loud enough I could hear it regardless of most music, and even if I couldn't hear it, I could feel it.
"You were saposed to come"
"HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW THAT"
Then she starts calling your by your full name.
so fucking relatable
Moms..smh
ikr
When will you kids learn .... she hears you fine, it means get off your arse and come here.
My mother‚Äôs hearing is wonky but she has the fucking TV volume at like 8 and I can‚Äôt barley hear it and she acts like it‚Äôs fine- like ma‚Äôam?
She is waiting for you to come into the kitchen, not yell rudely from across the house. (Source: I am Mom).
Imagining yelling ‚Äúyeah‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyes ma‚Äôam?‚Äù Can‚Äôt relate :,)
Bitch if she‚Äôs calling you from the kitchen she‚Äôs calling you down to see her.

What‚Äôs she supposed to do? Carry on this ordinary conversation through 3 sets of walls?
ü§£ü§£ü§£
The reason they don't hear you from the kitchen is because they want you to get up and come there. (Not a mom)
^^biitch
Applies to wives too.
We were definitely not allowed to say ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù or ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù. Only acceptable response was, ‚ÄúComing‚Äù followed by exasperatedly getting up for whatever she needed. She did, however, just say ‚ÄúGuys, time to eat‚Äù when it was dinner time.
Indeed..
Hi can I have some conversation with you pleas!!!
PNG native,.....
... Not Just your mum. I think that super hearing comes wiht a job.
Not even a joke. 

Mom: ‚ÄúCan you empty the dishwasher for me?‚Äù 
Me: ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù

- 10 Minutes after the Dishwasher is Empty ‚Ä¢

Mom: ‚ÄúWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?‚Äù
Bahaha she heard you. She was waiting for you to walk yourself to the kitchen.
To most parents living in today's world, make a group chat for your family.

It would most likely save you a hell of a lot more time and frustration than yelling at your teenage child that probably has headphones in or is playing a video game.
Moms hear and see everything
omg so true
Mothers do not hear, they absorb meaning when you are in their presence.
they hear what they wanna hear. don't miss an opportunity to scold us lol
Maybe because she didnt want a reply, but for you to be there?
Or when you grunt about something you‚Äôre doing such as being on a video game and losing and she thinks you were talking to her.
#dude.
She can hear you. But she wants to summon you. It's intentional.
What if he sits on it
You can put anything in those boxes and make it look like that. Next year do a table!
Wow awesome wrapping job! I almost thought it was a shelf!
Dude I'd wear that coat it looks good
I once put a hat inside a giant box and wrapped it like that.
Looks more like a PS5
Didnt know your dad had 2 heads

Edit: so that is what it looks like to sort by new, thanks !
I want to do this can you explain what you did did you just have the cost int he box on the chair and rap it all together?
i put my dads gift card taped to a drill battery wrapped and attached to a drill which i wrapped and then put that wrapped drill in a bucket and wrapped it. he was very surprised lmao
I thought it was a LEGO USC Star Destroyer.
Say try your new chair and watch it crumple
"Please be a PS5"
Fucken legend
Holy shit that is amazing, I love it
It's obviously a teapot. Anyone can see that
Yooo that‚Äôs amazing! Lol imagine if he sits on it haha
I hope I won't forget that idea till next year
Hope it's a motorcycle
The moment he sits on it to realize the seat is the only solid part of the chair
wow that‚Äôs some skilled wrapping, good job!
Well, now I know how to make socks look exciting!
How very Jim Halpert of you
I am a champion at unwrapping I can unwrap all this in 5 sec- *Tries to sit on char but falls through it to the floor*
Must have a small dad because that is one very small box for a "coat"
Sneak 100
For all of you talking about this being on tiktok, I literally had no idea. I was actually inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/kjbwvl/my_friend_finished_wrapping_his_wifes_presents/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
Oh you think that‚Äôs bad, I‚Äôm wrapping my gifts in IPad cases
Ah yes, 
The Trickster
Kinda looks like a car? You sure that‚Äôs a coat?
Your dad looking at this post: interesting
Get a box, put a coat in it, then use some PVC tubes to make a chair shape. Wrap it the boom, you‚Äôve got a coat in a chair shaped box.
genius.
i need to know how to do this in the next 24 hours
Dude I hope it‚Äôs a bike
Damn, imagine having a car shaped present for your 18 year old son/daughter/they only to find out it is a pair of socks.
Hmm. Seems chairy.
Wait no actually wtf is it
[removed]
And I thought Loki was the god of mischief. How the turntables
Yeah, Merry Christmas to you too.
Wait ho did he even manage to put coat into a chair shaped packag-.... oh, i see
I would never know what that was
I forget that you guys aren't on tiktok
You should add some cross bars to the chair back. Otherwise it would theoretically be uncomfortable to sit in.
That‚Äôs class ahaha
I usually just get money for Christmas but this time it was a small present.

when I opened it, it was just some chocolate and i had to try so hard to be happy with it because I didn‚Äôt expect it and thought my parents must‚Äôve been going through a rough time.

After thanking them i looked inside and what did I find alongside the chocolate? You guessed it, it was money.

Now I had to try really hard not to be happier because than they‚Äôd think the chocolate wasn‚Äôt enough for me

I think they were onto me though and now i feel really bad lmaoüò≠
The trickster
i like your fish pillow :p
Is there a sub for wrapping things to look like other things? I feel like there should be
"I hope its a playstation 5"
Your dad after opening the gift: I wish it was the chair
_Illusion 100_
Doesn't look like a very warm cost
420 IQ
I'm late and I must say I see what you've done here and congratulate you
DECEPTION
Next time get him a chair but wrap it in a normal box
Did you get him a PS5?
I'm copying that idea. I bought a chair as a present so I will wrap it like a coat.
Wait I'm dumb is it a coat wrapped like a chair right?
You should smash it over his back like a pro wrestler and then the box with the coat opens and all of the sudden he‚Äôs wearing it. It‚Äôll work, trust me on this one.
Dude why so many laser pointers?
Yea wait til he try‚Äôs to sit on it and realize it‚Äôs not a chair üòÇ
Where within this contraption is the coat located?
Is it wrong that I want him to sit on it



I‚Äôm sorry I like fail videos
How!?! 
I still don‚Äôt understand how people pull this off
This is so cool might be dumb to ask but how did you do it?
That's cool
Deception 100
Damn, that's great!
Thats amazing I'm happy for you :D
can u pm me how u gained weight? im struggling with it :(
That‚Äôs amazing! My daughter has struggled to put weight on for the past 4 years. She gets bad bouts of nausea from stress. Meds don‚Äôt help and it scary. We can‚Äôt find a md to help her bc she uses MJ for appetite and docs only want to push prescriptions that she tried and didn‚Äôt work bc it‚Äôs stress. She is only 20 and I‚Äôm desperate to get her to a healthy weight. She sits at 100 and when she has the nausea she can drop down to 95lbs very quickly. She dealt with severe bullying in HS. It‚Äôs a rough road. You‚Äôre doing a great job and you look awesome!!
What's it like struggling with that? I always hear people sum it up to "just eat more" but there's gotta be more to it than that right?
You‚Äôre making great progress, enjoy the award :)

Edit: Jesus Christ
Great job! You look really nice!
Congratulations. My friend went through the same so I know how hard it must have been. You have done well.
from sticc to thicc. Congrats on your recovery, I'm glad to hear you managed to beat the beast :)
Keep up the brilliant work don't let anyone get you down
*CREEPY PMS INCOMING*
Let me just say, I'm sorry for your inbox. Great work!
Hey woe congrats on the weight gain , I‚Äôm trying to do the same as well but I‚Äôm not anorexic fortunately. Im glad it got better for you :)
OP how fucked are your dms rn
yay!! so proud!
Congratulations
I‚Äôm 15 but I had really bad habits of throwing up my food for 3 years or so, got bad this year and I got hospitalized. It‚Äôs hard. But! we got this. congrats.

This makes me so happy! Anorexia is a hard thing to get out of. My girlfriend just got over hers pretty recently and it's a big accomplishment. Good for you! Also I like your hair and glasses

As a male who went through anorexia as well, I know it's been hard and I'm so proud you got through this
Teach me. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù 150lbs
Great job! I‚Äôm really proud of you and the work you‚Äôve done!
Going to the controversial section of these comments is disgusting. Half of them are "thicc" or have to do with the attractiveness of the girl like stop sexualizing any fucking post with a girl in it you incels


Also congrats on the recovery!
Congratulations! On behalf of r/teenagers we are all proud of you
actaully fantastic, i had a friend who had anorexia and i can understand the struggle of having to deal with it, hope your doing fine
That's really nice to see üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ I hope you can continue like this for a very long time üíû
Way to go!! I‚Äôve been there before, that shit‚Äôs hard to beat
Good work. I currently have a best friend who thinks she's fat and she's suffering from anorexia. Any tips on what she should do and what I can do to help her?
I'm proud of you, chief (:
Hi! Fellow victim of past anorexia, can I just say that you look absolutely beautiful and I'm so proud of you!! I know it can be hard, stressful, and painful to go through this kind of recovery, so you're a bad ass for kicking its butt like you have. Keep it up!!]
Atta girl! Don‚Äôt let anyone give you crap
I feel bad for the dms
Well done you're doing great and must be feeling good too! Orangepeel
Yup, you do be looking kinda fresh tho
what does annorexia do? Hope you have a good recovery, keep up the good work!
You look so great!! I'm really happy for you &lt;3
Holy FUCK, congrats bro üëèüëèüëè
My sister died of anorexia and I am so glad to see you and others fighting the good fight!  Man how I wish Reddit (and modern internet) were around back then...  

Keep it up - you can do it!!!
I'm incredibly proud of you!! Sharing this can be really tough but it adds so much to breaking the stigma and from one survivor to another know that it isn't an easy road but recovery is so worth it!
I wish I saw journeys like this celebrated just as much as weight loss ones. Both are equally as difficult, but one isn‚Äôt given the attention it deserves because a physical challenge is viewed as harder than a mental one. 

From one teenage girl person with an eating disorder (physical; Cancer‚Äôs a bitch and it‚Äôs near-impossible to put on weight when you have it), your accomplishments are just as valid as mine. Your weight gain journey is just as valid and inspiring as a weight loss one. 

You deserve to feel every iota of pride that you do. I can‚Äôt imagine how difficult it must have been for you.
I wasnt paying attention and i thought i was on r/roastme for a second, this could have been bad
funny thing is you could reverse the pic order and put 'im trying to loose some weight' note and ppl would congrats you. you look fine on both pic, fit look on the left, thicc look on the right.
Howd you manage to gain weight, because i cannot for the life of me

The Thirsty Simp part 2 overcrowded inbox
Ok, now this makes me feel bad, because I have the body of OP on the left. Am I actually anorexic? People at school call me skinny sometimes, but I really don't think I am. I'm really insecure about my legs at school because of that. Sure, I'm slim, but am I to the point of anorexia?
You go girl!!!
That's amazing!
Congrats currently recovering for anorexia
Congrats recovering from anorexia as else
goodluck, very happy for you :D
Amazing
So inspirational
My sister went through anorexia and I saw firsthand hoe though that shit is. Kudos
You look so much better!
Good job girl! It's amazing to see a recovery like this!
That‚Äôs good news! Congrats on beating anorexia.
I want to eat more but I can‚Äôt. I have a crippling fear of being overweight. If I try to gain weight it works for a while until bipolar, you know, exits, and then I starve myself because I don‚Äôt feel like I earned to right to eat. How did you convince yourself to eat?
Hope you're ready for creepy DMs
So happy for you!! You look a lot healthier and I know it takes a lot of strength. Every two months or so I keep cycling back and fourth between losing like 15-10 lbs and then gaining it all back and gaining weight back hurts like hell every time and makes me depressed (actually like right now).
Damn you look great, ik how hard it can be to gain weight, but you look amazing
Glad you can see our perspective
Been recovering from bulimia. Eating disorders are a bitch, I‚Äôm so proud of you bitch!
rip your dms
I dealt with anorexia my freshman year of hs. Thought I would never get through it. 7 years later, I‚Äôm healthy, happily married, learning about what I love, and have a lil pup. I‚Äôm proud of you for pushing through! Fight the good fight :) you are worth it. Wishing you the best!
Now that‚Äôs an epic victory royale
Congrats
Amazing. Keep pushing forward !
Proud of you!

I was thinking the exact same thing every time I saw one of these memes.
Honestly, this just proves that schools tests your memory, not how much you learn. If they had questions that you actually needed to understand the subject instead iof just remembering the answer, this would be solved.
One teacher (who was a horrible teacher and person) thought the class wouldn't cheat. 

We use teachers own weapon against him. *Zoom*
The kid with a phone? More like everyone with a phone.
Download brave browser, it disables cross-site tracking so the test website will never know when you change tabs

I always laugh at my teachers puns/jokes/memes. They‚Äôre either: actually funny; the teacher wanting to make us laugh; or if you laugh then the class joins in. :)
Did this format come from George of the Jungle?
How tf did I get this as a trending notification
Ah, a classic template
THIS IS THE WHOLESOME CONTENT I LIVE FOR

This is too sweet of you! My students are only five so they‚Äôre pretty easy to impress!
Dude, I would fake laugh if my teacher does this. Just trying to make studies fun is appreciable
*READY?*

My wife is a high school teacher. She makes silly memes in lessons at times and even sings silly songs during lectures and she tells me "I know it's super cringy, but at least I know they'll remember it"
Nah chem memes a good portion of the times are funny
Ahhh back when I had "the boys"
My World History teacher does the same thing and some of his memes are of good quality. Sometimes even the elders know of the current times.
Honestly when that happens, I still think it‚Äôs genuinely funny (most of the time), just because of the fact that it‚Äôs a teacher who put the meme in there
üçî
Not my class's case. There when a teacher tries something like that were all like: ._____.
Ahh yess. George of the Jungle
George of the Jungle memes?

*Invest*.
i always laugh because it's funny to me that they're trying
Holy shit I‚Äôm old, haven‚Äôt seen that one in forever
FR. I hate classmates who just diss the teacher, especially when it's clear they tried and that they care about what they're doing. Idc that it's a garbage meme bro, i care that the teacher is actually trying and is compassionate about their job and towards their students.
Dude look like Samuel L. Jackson ngl.
They just want us to feel some sort of happiness during school and I can respect that
All the memes were like: You cannot simply just......
This is so wholesome
As a teach who tries to be funny with memes and jokes, thank you. I appreciate you.
We should appreciate teachers like these
Sometimes they‚Äôre so bad they‚Äôre good.

Like r/okbuddyretard without the cringy 10 year olds who think poop in that one font with stewie griffin is funny
Teacher be like : I've achieved komedy
Always do that for my teachers :)
kinda true ngl
I dunno what this meme is about. Everybody knows that teacher showing memes want us to laught but they're failing every time but hey, there is a plot twist, THEY KNOW THIS MEMES SUCK
I was the 69 thousandth up vote,this is the most important I've ever felt
I still have a folder of memes from 2004. Like hundreds.
this literally happened to me today in science, we have a new teacher and she has put all these memes in it, they are so bad that we have to laugh. haha.
Hell yeah. Teachers who try their best to make learning fun for their students are the best teachers.
Thank you for not being like the stupid girls who start to criticize the meme.
Or the nerd who starts to explain it.
I had a teacher 2 years ago that was pretty young so she kinda understood our humor but she was a bitch. She once showed a meme that was actually funny so we laughed when she showed it, and any time it was referenced (or somehow reminded of it) in the presentation, a few of my classmates would let out a chuckle. This prompted her to activate her total bitch self and got angry at my classmates for laughing and disturbing the class. They tried to defend themselves saying that they were laughing as they remembered the meme but our teacher didn‚Äôt really care and assumed that they were laughing at her. She was a mess.
crappy 2008 meme? why am i up in the presentation?! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

well itd be 2007 but close enough
r/wholesomememes
Yea this year our teacher put up the fortnite black knight dancing at the beginning of the year trying to be nice nobody wanted to dance but we all laughed and this one kid says "you know thats like 2 years old" she wasn't mad but that was such a asshole move she just said "oh I need to get with the time" with some fake laughter idk y but some people just have to destory the fun
I feel bad for the teachers that gets shit for trying to make class more fun.
because that's what heroes do
why does this have so many upvotes it's a good meme but ??? lol
This is not a meme though
my sewing teacher has old memes in the classroom about cutting paper with fabric scissors but i respect her for using the right format
This doesn‚Äôt even matter. What does tho is how tf you‚Äôve accumulated 6 million Karma...
Nobody gonna talk about the number of comments tho...

My accounts is basically a year older and you have so much more karma than me, what even is this... 
How do you post so much?
Why is your post history bottomless?
#w h y
 I actually would‚Äôve upvoted it if the drawing was holding you
How the absolute fuck do you have 6 million karma
And then you put them both in one and you get over 1k upvotes
one time i asked people to dm me saying i was male, i got like 2 dms, then i did one saying im a girl, 13 dms, we live in a society
A w-woman?!!????

This girl literally makes expert memes as often as I make my parents disappointed damn. Also, I can smell the simping from all the way under this California smoke.
Makes meta commentary: 15k upvotes
Wait hold the fuck up we look really similar
Genius. With this data I can build an AI with near limitless possibilities. We can cure all diseases, end world hunger, end racism, and even become a space fairing society.
The upvote difference is not enough to decide yes or not if the experiment is successfull. 2 is a too small difference to say anything. However, the comment difference is way more interesting. 3 times bigger.
Like how the lines for limbs don't connect to the body completely and how the eyes swirl. It represents the disconnect we have from ourselves and how we see the world in this diluted fashion and smile through it all. This artist clearly has a craft for dreary simplitism that i haven't seen in years. 

Bravo to your brilliance my friend. üé©üßê
Next time try a full body shot and see how high the up votes soar.
/r/upvotedbecausegirl
Hi (sorry if that offended you)
Me posts on reddit: I‚Äôm bored, anyone want to talk?

My DMs: ...

Me posts on reddit right after: I‚Äôm bored, anyone want to talk? (F)

My DMs: 64
Too little sample size, not reliable information as to reddit people being simps. Also what is wrong with being a simp? You like a girl try to impress her and make her feel good about herself and try to get in a relationship with her. I see no problem with that
I know this is an old post and then she had 6 million karma

But now she has 8 FUCKING MILLION
How do you get that?

I don't know about our guys but slaughtering demons with metal music in the background is pretty calming especially after a long day of bullshit.
Me with stardew
wtf is calming about minecraft exactly like one second you're chilling in the cave mining redstone for your next machine end the other second you're dead because a bigass walking bomb desided so
Don‚Äôt know about you guys but i see death stranding as pretty relaxing
Minecraft, calming... yeah try falling into a cave full of mobs with your only diamonds we found
I think people just shouldn‚Äôt shame anyone poor playing games they like, which is something this sub does quite a lot with things like Fortnite, even when a few years back, Minecraft was as despised.
[deleted]
I hate it when someone calls me out for playing a calming game everyday for hours.


Just let me slay demons dammit
Minecraft is a peaceful game until you play a sweaty multiplayer game like Skywars. If we‚Äôre playing that youre not my friend anymore youre just another player stopping me from getting a win
Ironic. Half this sub bullies kids for liking fortnite
[deleted]
Just be happy they're all gaming doesnt matter what it is just enjoy your game of choice and thats it!
Every calming thing has an end, while Doom **IS ETERNAL**
But if I play fortnite it‚Äôs bad. I don‚Äôt get you people.
I honestly see more hate against people who dont like those games, I dared to say I disliked animal crossing and everyone got pretty pissed, so I wouldnt quite agree.
I wish i have a switch üò≠
Obviously shes never been lost in a cave with diamonds
Minecraft is one of the most flexible games i‚Äôve ever come across. You have so much to choose: Building, Electronics and coding, PvP fights, and a lot more. It‚Äôs no wonder that it‚Äôs the best selling game in existence.
Animal Crossing? Calming?
this is why I hid the fact that I played minecraft when I was in middle school, 2013~ I believe. It was a time where it was acceptable to hate people who played minecraft much like how people today hate people who play fortnite.
My friend is always like aNiMaL cRoSsINg Is So BoRiNg HoW cAn YoU eNjOy It? And I‚Äôm just like because I find it fun
Skyrim for me
Minecraft is da bomb
these are my least favorite type of people. somehow minecrafts only a "real" video game when guys play it :(
I‚Äôve just never really been able to understand the appeal of animal crossing
No problem with that just don‚Äôt nuke my twitter feed with pictures of your village please?
why do girls not like guys who play minecraft is the question

edit: SOME girls
And then i get called gay for making a rose garden in my minecraft world
Me when someone talks about stardew valley
I switch from doom to minecraft every half an hour, doom makes my heart die every time I play it.
Fucking CALMING? Yeah okay, try being me in New Horizons, making tarantula islands every other day, that shit is so fucking stressful. And don‚Äôt get my started hearing fucking cave sounds in mc
For those of you who are asking how tf minecraft‚Äôs calming,


Turn rtx on or add shaders then build something. Put on lofi music as well



Also animal crossing is relaxing af
I fucking raged at Animal Crossing the other night. I was fishing for a Marlin which are only available at select times. I was casting and casting for quite some time. There was suddenly a shadow of a large fish then I missed the fish. I fucking knew that it was a Marlin. But deep down, I will truly never know. It still eats me up.
I like killing some local villagers, exploding a town with TNT, then after that I go play minecraft. Pretty relaxing.
I actually don't get the Animal Crossing appeal at all
I haven't heard of anyone shaming someone for playing either of those games, but alright
The only reason I shame my friend for playing it is because he has 50 hours in 5 days...
Me currently building a city on animal crossing and getting mad that trees and buildings are in the way
I‚Äôm not one for shaming, but don‚Äôt act like planting flowers is entertaining.
I‚Äôm always getting shit from my siblings for liking games like Animal Crossing, Minecraft, and Stardew Valley.

I‚Äôve got anxiety and it helps a little bit. I‚Äôm *sorry* that I don‚Äôt see the point in sitting myself through a game that I‚Äôve been watching you complain about for the last 7 years, and caused you to break your best friends computer.
Playing Minecraft while reading this lol
Steep is very underrated exactly because of this.
I don't have anything against animal crossing, but it's not really my type of game. I would've at least tried playing it if I have a switch and wasn't born in a poor family
Try ‚ÄúHot line Miami‚Äù It really calm and the music is really beautiful.
Reminds me of the the time someone called me a slut and a 5 year old for playing animal crossing new leaf
Just know animal crossings fan base is just as toxic as any other game.
Animal Crossing can be intense tho when you don't pay your debts to Tom Nook
No one insults the Light Up Keyboard
‚Äúi dont have a webcam‚Äù
problem solved
I have a headset that has RGB lights that I got for Christmas, but I can turn the lights off.
Wait until you see my RGB mousepad, RGB keyboard, RGB mouse and my RGB gaming rig that is basically an aquarium.

light up keyboards are sick
At least with the extra LEDs your computer will run faster
Dude online class is so productive!!! I managed to make an entire trading hall, get a horse and get a bunch of cool trades from a villager breeder in minecraft.
they were laughing in excitement
Let me guess they had 4k high resolution High definition webcam?
Who the fuck laughs at lighted up keyboards
but they get wet when they see my custom build keeb
i dont understand why teachers want the webcam on :( it's so uncomfortable
Lmao look at this dude with his sketchers computer headass time to sneak in a few hot chip during class
as a light up keyboard owner, i am truly disappointed
*Cherry Mx blue key switch clicking intensifies*
Light up keyboards make you the ultimate chad, I don‚Äôt know what those girls are doing

That's when you pull out this:

Wdm the hot girl in my class is a gamer too
My biology teacher said I look like a streamer just because I had a monitor and over ear headphones. Thank God my new ones don't have lights.
Wait till they see my rgb asshole
To make up a story about girls paying attention to him.
My mom is forcing me to get a webcam so I bought a streamer cam
When my state starts online classes, I‚Äôm using my voice changer on all them fools
Are people actually having classes where they use webcams? I assumed everybody did it in google classroom and the webcam thing was just a meme.
Dude, this one kid was wearing an ahegao sweatshirt and the teacher asked if it was a cow one and pinned his cam. It was hilarious
Wtf, light up keyboards are awesome.... Our bro is in a class of dumb fucks obviously
[deleted]
oOf
Just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a camera‚Äù
As a girl who has a light-up keyboard I say fuck those normies live your extra gamer life bro
Except the girl with the really high quality camera and sitting on her bed with a high quality mic and heart shaped pillows
We are the most oppressed of minorities
Imagine judging people by physical items

This comment was made by the respect gang
Weird camera angle if it show your keyboard, no?
Make the room dark so all they see are you your beautiful agile fingers dancing on those lit keys
Can't you just turn off the lights or zoom more towards the face
Show them your light up Skechers next
Why do people find light up keyboards laughable? That shit looks cool. I have one that responds to sound &amp; it‚Äôs the coolest shit ever.
My class doesn't have any girls and we're all gamers, problem solved
I have a RedDragon Mechanical keyboard with MX Blues that click with every key press. So glad im not doing english this semester....
light up keyboard?
RGB MASTER RACE.
rgb master race
say you don‚Äôt have one next time
Fam light up keyboards are great I can play snake on mine.
Show her your light up shoes and then they‚Äôll do a total 180¬∞
fuck those girls
This sounds fake. Do people really suck this much?
Imagine spending 8 hours in online class instead. That's me. I wish I didn't have a back.
Games can distract you from the pain. During online school, pain is the distraction
The only memes my mom sends me are Russian memes, I can translate one for you
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you look closely enough in this picture, you can see two clowns staring at each other

*image of a clown staring at the camera*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks mom
My mom only sends me minion memes..
Oh my goodness I remember playing black ops zombies with my pals and we‚Äôd play for days organizing pee, shower and food breaks to get to high levels. 

But one 2 hour class and it was like we had been in a car accident.
Eh, for me, video games are my main source of entertainment, the pain I feel from sitting for hours is basically non existent, because im doing something I enjoy, but during school, I am forced to sit there, doing something that has caused me so much anxiety in the past, and I don't want to be there. Im going on a lot of rants today....
She ain‚Äôt wrong, thing about it with all the stress of school your muscles contract and tense up so your back will hurt but with video game it won‚Äôt because video games are not stressful
I slouch in my chair so low that my entire family is getting concerned about what will happen to my spine.
FB/SarcasmLol
I'm scared that ur mom's up to date on her memes
Your mom is a wise individual
Satisfactory has got me at 12 hours
I sit in a shit chair and my back hurts for both
i mean it‚Äôs not wrong...
ONLY 8?! THAT'S TOO LOW
Ima send it too my mom
I relate dar too much
I cant sit down and play videogames for that long without being extremely anxious
Why is this true though lol, I can sit at my computer all day and not hurt, but as soon as my 2-hour class ends I need to stretch
u/Xeras6101 put it beautifully
for me it‚Äôs 8 hrs of school and 1 hr of games
this meme is pretty fire. tell your mom i said hi
But in all fairness, it‚Äôs easier to get invested in something you enjoy than to force yourself to do something
Seeing a lot of posts about back pain here, while posture and stretching are important during long sessions, most back pain can be avoided by a strong back and core. Run, ruck, squat, dead lifts, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If you start now with body weight and/or dumbbells, it'll get you ready for when gyms actually open. One of my bigger regrets in life is that I didn't start running and hitting the weights as soon as I hit puberty.
I have a 3 hour zoom call Tuesday‚Äôs and Thursday‚Äôs where the professor requires cameras to be turned on or your grade gets dropped
*silence boomer*
rlly i just get tired either way after about an hour
I don't even have a desk :( . My back hurts like shit
u/repostsleuthbot

Bot messaged me, your mom didnt send this to you
Well i don't really relate because max time i can play is one hour, i get off stuff pretty fast
Universal TruthüòÑüòÑ
Bruh
There was an infected guy in my class but yeah still no online school. Gotta save money to buy more water fountains!!
I'm waiting on a mouse that's coming at 2pm and it feels like forever because I have online classes
To be fair prisons aren‚Äôt exactly fun
Games are a distraction, school ads onto the pain
I‚Äôm still in school from 8 to 3:10 and I‚Äôm trying not be complain to my parents
It wasn't very
Do you guys really have online classes?

I just had 1 month of staying home and getting tasks per email, for the rest of the pandemic we had school like every other normal day
I can spend 15ish hours gaming and be fine, but one class and ded
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
That‚Äôs because I have to sit up with a computer instead of moving around, lying down, etc.
I saw this meme on r/ich_eil in german, so now it‚Äôs weird seeing it in English
8 hours? That‚Äôs insulting low
Report:


I‚Äôm in this picture and i don‚Äôt like it
Damn your mom makes better memes than actual meme makers
I too carry my classmates in online class
So I tried to post and I got a message saying I needed karma. What‚Äôs karma and how do I get it
Bc we actually doing something we want and we can move where ever, do what ever, and say what ever
Try sitting at a cash register for 30 seconds. 8 hour shifts are killing me.
take my award
In school, you feel the pain, Video games...numb the pain
It‚Äôs almost as if, we feel better doing stuff we enjoy
*reads the title*

Thats gotta hurt
I have 8 hours of online class and do about 2 hours of video games :/
Tbf my back hurts after playing games too because my chair is absolutely horrible
At least it‚Äôs Accurate
thats because the stress of class is harsher on your back than it is to carry your teammates or bad AI
Yeah because video games keep you engaged the whole time, but online classes on the other hand...
Actually my back hurts all the time
My ass hurts either way
Protect your mom, please.
You have better posture when you are gaming, because of all the gfuel
The water mark is what got me.
My body does this cool thing where I have to shit whenever I try to start doing work
The best part is their presentations are always 2x longer than everyone else's so it only takes a couple of then to waste an entire class period
I decided in high school that if I went first absolutely no judgement was cast on me as everyone was still thinking of their own presentations. Real anxiety killer.
I always wait until the last minute and hope that we run out of time
You always go first that way you get it over with
[removed]
I was the 3rd in line last year and my presentation lasted the whole class. People were happy but it lasted till the end of the 4th presentation as it only lasted like 15 mins.
You're welcome :)
Happened in first period today, thanks chad!
I don't have a choice. I'm always first alphabetically.

(ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)
This happened to me yesterday. I was close to finishing up my presentation and like 5 people volunteered early, making me the 15th person to have to go. 14 went and if they had taken a minute shorter I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten away with an incomplete project.
In 8th, I spent an entire class period doing my project. Your welcome, guys.
I got yall. But honestly there‚Äôs a good reason to go first. You have no one to be compared to and you get it over with
Im the kid who presents first, and its not finished, but I get bonus points for trying which allowed me to pass those presentations
A few weeks ago my parents got an email saying that their child was an amazing worker and wanted to present first

Thing is, she drew my name out of a cup and I was forced to present
u/RepostSleuthBot
In most cases, when you volunteer you get extra marks and you know I'm hungry for those marks
Are you in my math class?
When I volunteer to go first it's because people have nothing to compare my crappy presentation to until *after* I've already gone

Presentations are stupid. That‚Äôs all.
I always try to go first when possible. Not only do you get it over with, but most teachers also grade a little easier if you are first.
My bitchass friend volunteered me to go first yesterday, motherfucker better learn to sleep with his eyes open
I just noticed, That‚Äôs a horrible grenade throw. And why does it have a fuse?
[fuck you](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/e6svt3/thank_you_to_the_kids_who_do_that/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
Once I made mine 15 min long on talking about the oceans and Segway into talking about both world wars
My year has made a tradition of standing and applauding for whoever does this... mainly because literally no one is ready to go by the due date.
I have always and will always present first. The teacher usually goes easier on whoever volunteers, I get it over with so I don‚Äôt have to spend the next several days feeling anxious about it, and by the time we get to the end of presentations no one even remembers what I‚Äôve said.
Wtf bro, don‚Äôt be a shithead and repost this, that‚Äôs just fucking stupid. Make some fucking original content. Stealing is stupid stop it now. This is a fucking repost people don‚Äôt upvote it.
Thief...
I go first to:
a) let others prep more or because they ask me
b) I don't want to forget everything I had thought out
c) I try make a standart: often I try to go for a worse than normal
I just finished a presentation for a class, opened reddit, and this was the first post I saw. Interesting...
so true tho. but that feeling when you get called last before class ends when there's no more volunteers left is the *worst*
If my internet weren't shit. The post would've loaded.

Im literally in class rn waiting for presentations to end but the teacher is cool and lets us be on our phones
Thanks Flash, hope you‚Äôve handed it over.

This is a repost
Pathetic. You mere mortals are no match for me and my secret human ability to work on the presentation while others are presenting and getting a 100 for a grade. But seriously idk how I got away with this a couple times. I'm so sorry Ms Steiner.
I was the kid who always went first because my theory was that if no one went before me, then no one would notice how bad mine was because they didn‚Äôt have anything to compare it to
"do you know that one kid who always goes first in every presentation?"

"Of course I know him, that's me"

The caption is wrong as for a few frames in second 1, bottom left of the screen. As the door is force opened to these scene of teenage male bonding, that there are toes seen for only long enough to identify, that you OP (Assuming that you were behind the camera) are not wearing socks which makes you sir in fact a gay.

This used to be a comment of actual value, but since reddit is breaking 3rd party apps and denying my ability to get content from them, they don't get to have any content from me.

And they spelled it wrong
I could do this, I've won every game of kahoot I've ever played
Unfortunately used the wrong word; whose: that means who does it belong to. You want who's, meaning who is ;)
These guys are simultaneously the smartest in the class, the fastest in the class, and the most immature. But this has got to be one of my highlights of 2019!!
fun stuff but don‚Äôt forget the educative part of school my dudes. whose, me and my friends..
[deleted]
I can‚Äôt imagine how you feel right now. Just try to spend as much time with her as possible and give her a treat for me if you can.
Blind old thing, my dog might be put down too, kinda super sad
I have one request for you, my friend. Let her last day on this earth be amazing, let her know that she is the most cherished dog in the world. I trust that the latter part has been true since the day you two first laid eyes on one another, but any doggo deserves the best send-off possible. This world will be just one little bit darker without her smile...

Edit: Thanks for silver
She looks so happy
Can we get a RIP in chat for Tara the trooper I'm sure it's been hard for both of you
May she rest in peace
aw poor thing
F




Why is she being put down?
Tomorrow will suck big time... stay strong friend, and tell her that someone out there sends her love.
Hopefully she goes to Dog Heaven/ Squirrel Hell
Boop that snoot for me please
You gave her a good life
[removed]
:'(

Man. Thats sad. At least her last moments are spent with the ones she loves
Update:

She was put down today. I didn't go to school. It was a peaceful death, but I had to keep my two chihuahuas in mum's room. However, I got to say goodbye at the very end. Now she's at peace.

No, I was not karmawhoring with this. I expected this to be a small post that would die in rising, but apparently not. Thanks for the support, guys.

also, I don't care if you try to troll. I know that shit and you ain't getting any attention.

Thank you, r/teenagers.

*Goodbye Tara*

*2004-2020*

*Rest in peace.*
We love you Tara
Please pet her for me. She was the best girl. I know that u are  not going to respond to this but please remember her how she was .
She will be in doggie heaven
Tell her she is the best girl from all of us!
Rip man... I know how it feels when you lose a best friend. When my pug passed i felt hopeless. But hopefully you would get over it. Your dog looks very adorable I hope she appears in your dreams ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh no

I don't know what to say but this is just sad
RIP
What do you mean "put down"?

Idk much about pets.
RIP Doggoüíî
She looks like a great dog. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what is wrong with Tara?
Hope all is well‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫
You are making me cry
I hope she goes to dog heaven and rests :)
My Dog a couple years ago got put down, it was really sad since she had been with me since I was born. Tough times for me and my family, just liked to think she was in a better place.
Now I cry
not all dogs are good boys, some are good girls

F :'(
This hit me super hard and I'm not honestly not even a dog person... Poor girl, may she rest in peace
bye tara, we will miss you :&lt;
Why is she being put down?
Rest In Peace lil bro.
F poor doggo
F's in the chat. Im sorry
F

Hope she's had a good life.
Tell her that she's the goodest girl that ever did good! I'm sorry that she has to go so soon, losing a pet is never easy. Hope you're doing well enough.
I'm sorry for you.... I had to go through that too.... hurts like hell but you will get through it, for her. she looks so happy.

F from me too
I‚Äôm so sorry. I hope she lived a full and beautiful life.
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying

Pretty sure I‚Äôve got this one bookmarked too. It‚Äôs ‚ÄòBusty college girls full presentation on nucleotides - intro to genetics‚Äô

hmmm
Busty college girl fu... llfill their dream of becoming a productive member of society by going to school, getting good grades and passing with flying colors before getting a stable job and contributing to their country through work and taxes
Well at least now you know how to easily bump that C up to an A.
This is my worst fear when I send people screenshots from my laptop
"Busty college girl funds ground-breaking cancer treatment research."
BUSTY COLLEGE GIRL
Lmao imagine if he realized during the screen share that this was bookmarked for all of you to see and he just froze in shock and stopped talking lol
Busty college girl fulfill documents as her new job
You will never be able to look at him the same way again
He probably wanted to check the views he got
What kind of casual saves porn to the Bookmarks bar, instead of creating a rabbit hole of Bookmarks folders, or just saving the links in white text to a Google Doc?
Busty college girls fu&gt;!lfills her professors high expectations!&lt;
That's a bookmark, not a tab.
woah
Lmao my (gay) economics teacher had this too where the second thing in his search history starting with ex- was ‚Äúextra big dicks‚Äù, I absolutely died when I saw it.
This isn‚Äôt a mistake. It‚Äôs a bat signal and now he just waits to see who shows up.
This is actually some 5-D chess on the part of the professor. He can't come right out and say you can blow me for grades, but if he just let's this sit there then everyone will make their own decisions. It also doesn't outwardly show anything bad so he could lie if someone calls him out on it.
Ah i see, your professor is a man of culture
Fu could mean many things and one of those things is futa and that scares me
Bro he just had to assert dominance on all of you plebs
Pretty sure he was the producer for this one, really teaching his students to earn their As
You should tell him "nice bookmarks" and watch him freak out, it'd be hilarious.
Professor 
busty college girl fu
something‚Äôs not right here
Maybe... just maybe... you should report him. This is school with a school laptop and he really searching that? Like... bro
"Busty collage girl fu-"

Could it be,         a furry
I once had a sales guy do something like this.  He had left "cocaine infertility" in his search bar.  He left it there for so long I started to feel bad for him so I wrote a note and pushed it over to him.  He laughed and played it off like a boss saying that was a band he was looking for.   I left the meeting and immediately searched for this band...not a trace.
The busty college girl in his class must be Soo uncomfortable !
Can I get a link brother
Proof that professors can be retarded too.

He's not even making use of pornhub free premium!!!
LMAO THATS NOT A TAB ITS A BOOKMARK
As a college girl, if one of my professors had this tab, I'd be very freaked out. Yes we're technically adults, but professors are like ~real~ adults in a position of power, and to be fantasizing after someone in the position of your student...that's whack.

What's wrong with that?
Life Pro Tip: Always have an immaculately clean user account on your computer if you are going to present anything. Just log out of your main user and into the presentation one.
Ahh, yes. The nuke exploding that shatters the realm of space time, also known as a dad sneeze
*Whole house starts shaking

Hears a "bless you"

*Ahhhhhh*
Dad's and uncle's, they don't sneeze dawg they shout through their noses
My grandma gives people PTSD flashbacks with her sneezes
So dads give people orgasms
Omg one time I left the volume too high as a kid it scared me so bad I went upstairs and cried with my mom
Why do girls sneeze like that
Also the Wii.


When I was small I would always forget to check the volume, and we had a big CRT with beefy speakers so if it was loud it was LOUD. And I would always press the A button, hear the loud, sharp click as the starting screen fades, and then panic and mash the buttons on the tv to turn the volume down as the Wii menu music deafened me and my brother.
Theres that one girl in class who sneezes louder than an explosion
My mom and I sneeze very loud and my dad does these tiny little mouse sneezes lol
Not all women sneeze quietly, there's a manager at my work that scares every new person because her sneezes sound like a rocket
I inherited my dad‚Äôs dad sneeze.... I‚Äôm a 19-y.o. female.
my mom used to say "chewie" when she sneezed
Myself sneezing:

Nerf the 725, he sneezin too hard

Uncles at thanksgiving when they sneeze:  ‚ÄúNI....‚Äù
The dad sneeze doesn‚Äôt have a warning either. It just comes out of nowhere.
I sneeze almost silent and I'm a boy
Is that a shot Gun or a gas rifle? It looks very simular to the one  My granpa has for hunting  and it is super quiet
Only issue is that the rifle in the pic is an air rifle and is actually much quieter than the suppressed handgun
Repost
PS2 Startup is nothing compared to THX
Oh what, I sneezed! What, I'm not allowed to sneeze?!
One of the rare images that you can hear.
I guess im a dad.. im a 17 year old female..
I can hear this image.
I'm somewhere between a boy sneeze and a dad sneeze
I can hear this picture
And its not the package delivery to Hiroshima? Come on...its more related to the THX startup sound...
I can tell you, the girl one is a lie
I've got that dad sneeze down as a teen what dk
There was this girl in my sixth grade class that would sneeze so loud that you could have it from two rooms over. I'm not exaggerating at all, it was crazy.
Change sneeze to squeeze and it‚Äôs still true
repost
I'm a girl and I am very much a shotgun.
I know a girl who sneezes louder than a dads sneeze
My geography teacher sounds like she is crying when she sneezes
Dad gave me PTSD.
See, it's my mom who's really loud. Like, she can be in my basement, I'll be on the 2nd floor of our house, she sneezes, and I can hear her in my room with the door shut. How does that even happen???
People look around for a dog when my dad sneezes. I can locate him by the trail of people looking around confused after one of his minor nostril eruptions.
Once my dad sneezed and I thought for once how my PlayStation started working (+_+)
im already learning my dad's Nuclear Explosion style sneeze
Well. I'm not dad yet but I'm pretty sure that I could wake up some dead men with my sneez
Holy shit this is gold
I once had a dad sneeze so powerful that I slammed my head on my desk... And I'm not even a dad yet
imagine a godzilla sneeze

THX startup intensifies
I stop like mid sneeze so people look at me all weird LIKE OK IM ONLY SNEEZING
My mom sneezes 10x louder than my dad
Is that the PSX or PS2?
Not gonna lie, was anyone else spooked by the sound the red screen error on PS2 made?
My mom's and grandpa's sneezes are the loudest in the world, fight me
The only one who rivals my dad‚Äôs sneezes is my grandma...I can still hear the echoes.
My sneeze sounds like a Pikachu screaming and is high on Helium
I can sneeze completely silently. It feels anti-climatic to do it though. You expect a nuclear bomb but instead its a small  breeze of wind.
My friend Leaf when she sneezes: üí•
Asian uncle: ‚ÄúAre you challenging me?‚Äù
I can hear this picture
You should hear my grandpa...

There was this one time where he sneezed so loud and hard he popped a vain in his eye
Images I can hear
A dad‚Äôs sneeze is like the THX intro but bassboosted, and distorted
*house collapses*
Suppressors are actually loud though
my grandpa‚Äôs sneeze is like a fucking earthquake
Me sneezing: all of the above but at random
I bite my tounge when i sneeze so i make no noise at all
The last one is my mom, I can here it when I‚Äôm outside and she‚Äôs in the house
This is very accurate, I don't have a dad or a PlayStation so I don't know what either of those sound like.
Guess i sneeze like a girl
Grandpa's when they sneeze: *THX opening plays*
Grandfathers: THX intro
Pretty sure dropping your shampoo bottle whilst home alone is the loudest.
Ahhh, evolution

Beautiful?
You ever heard a dog sneeze? Shit will drown out a nuclear explosion for god sakes
My mom is like an atomic bomb. I swear the house shakes when she sneezes
VOLUME DOWN FOR GOD SAKES
I'm female and I sneeze loudly, but my dad sneezes really loudly and 7 times every time he sneezes
Uh, when my wife sneezes, people on the other aisles in the grocery store say, ‚Äúbless you.‚Äù   Her sneezes make babies cry, swear to God.  Her second grade students, every year, say ‚Äúwarn us when you do that,‚Äù after they recover from their initial shock.
my friend literally screams when he sneezes. it isn't even a thing he does to be funny. like when he sneezes, even in the middle of class, he just screams. it's so funny
Yep, I remember waking up early to sneakily play on the PS2, and triple checking to make this nuclear explosion wouldn't go off.
TIL I'm a dad.

Damn....

Hello mister....


Giving the problem I have and asking for a solution


Greetings
It‚Äôs not just your teachers, it‚Äôs your employers too 

I adore my teenage shop assistant, but my god girl, if you can‚Äôt come in, that‚Äôs cool, I don‚Äôt need an essay about why 

I get it, you‚Äôve got shit to do, it‚Äôs all fine, see you on Friday, promise I‚Äôm not going to fire you for missing one shift
I will spend over an hour formatting the perfect email to a teacher making sure it sounds exactly right and revising several times and then they just give the most casual response and I feel like I wasted effort lol
Dear Ms. Shakelbake

aye nigga can I have the test sheet again

Dear Mr. Jackson,

Bet
My friend had a very passive aggressive email conversation that went as follows:

My friend: "Hi Mr (insert teachers name) I was wondering if you could take me off of the classroom page because I can't unenroll myself. Thanks."

This mf goes: "Hi (insert friends name) you know that to start a conversation you should start by asking how their day is going, right?"

So my friend plays his little game and replies: "Hi how is your day going. Can you please take me off of the classroom."

And they go back and forth while the teacher is giving him email writing advice just to be an asshole and waste his time.
here is how my Social Studies Teacher expect emails

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Mr. \_\_\_\_\_,

I hope this e-mail finds you well. Could you please

provide me clarification? (State the nature of your

issue)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Have a great day/evening!

Kind Regards,

\_\_\_\_\_\_
They really not putting in the same effort as you
Unpopular opinion: there are many students and one teacher.
Formatting emails honestly especially for English teachers are ridiculous, there‚Äôs only been ONE instance I remember that one of the teachers I had for AP Lang she would type back with with actual proper formatting. Then again, she wasn‚Äôt some out of touch d i n o s a u r.
We here writing full essays meanwhile they get to write sre and get mad at us for misspelling one fucking word. 

Fuck off Courtney you fucking asshole, necessary is way harder to type than fucking sure, just grade my fucking paper instead of critiquing my email over a zoom call you threatened to fail me if I didn‚Äôt join earlier in class.
I had a teacher who yelled at me only for not saying "Good afternoon" when I said "Hi Mrs. HerName". She said emails should be professional but when she told me that OVER EMAIL she didnt use any polite greetings like she said I should lol
For ICT work in my school we have to email our finished coursework to our teaches.

We were told to write a good couple lines, sign off with our names, be polite, so it's formal.

Sent coursework to my teacher today, took a good ten minutes writing the email.

The reply:

"DONE."
I feel this. In school we were taught ‚Äúemail etiquette,‚Äù but whenever I email a teacher mine is way better looking than theirs
I emailed my teacher saying my wifi was being a giant bitch and even though I had WiFi that ugly ass dinosaur would show up on my screen. My mom yelled at me but my teacher responded ‚ÄúCool. Turn it in when your internet mans up a lil.‚Äù Fucking love that guy.
They say to write formally then respond with just ‚Äúok‚Äù
TRUE
how come my teacher says lol to me but i have to capitalize properly in the chat
Because we answer 100 of those emails all day long

Edit: I would also like to add that at least 90% of students don‚Äôt email like that.
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?

Sometimes people need to learn to cut out the fat.  Sometimes they need to learn that they're not providing sufficient context.  If you're asking a yes/no question, "sure" seems like an entirely appropriate response.
im the opposite
shore*
Fuckk this always happens to me. They are just saying ‚ÄûGood work.‚Äú nothing more, nothing less.
THIS IS SOOOOO MY LIFE. Apart from my French teacher who actually replied with the correct formalities, but like my history teach told us we had a test to catch up by sending "you'll catch up on the test Wednesday". That's it.
I just don‚Äôt even have any greeting when sending an email to a teacher. I just say the message that needs to be said and that‚Äôs it. It saves your time and it saves their time.
Don‚Äôt worry. When you grow up your boss will do the exact same thing. When you asked them an either or question. And when you write back asking for clarification, they will not respond.
My mom is a teacher and she is always on the run and doing things. She knows her students need help so even if she is really busy she will try to respond and help. Teachers have lives so they try to help but don‚Äôt always have the time to think things all the way through
Agonize over a slack message to a colleague you've never really interacted with.

Edit, re-edit, delete, decide it's not really that urgent...

Rewrite cause you NEED to talk to this person because it's not urgent but nobody else will know the answer. 

Delete again. Rewrite. Try to be casual but polite. Bury the lead in some pleasantries. 

Sweating, hit send. 

Reply: thumbs up emoji

Die inside.
As a teacher, all I ask is don‚Äôt give me an entire email in the subject line. That‚Äôs all I ask!!
and then they get mad at you if you don‚Äôt do it properly like that
few days ago i asked my psychology teacher if he could extend the due date for an assignment since I had a doctor's appointment to go to on that day. i replied with the most well thought out email i could and the man literally replies with 'ok'
[deleted]
Yeah then they'll get in your ass about not writing to them perfectly.
Edit: *on
Don't forget the teacher complaints about students and their inappropriate emails
I wrote a 7 paragraph email to my teacher addressing my mental state and she replied ‚ÄúK‚Äù and proceeded to call cops on me
a girl in my class copied my whole project... i sent a whole email to the prof, provided screenshots, i had all the grammar and shit right... i read it a million times, i made sure to add EVERYTHING.... and all i got was an "ok"
Haha sounds like some things never change... This is just like emailing an executive...

Employee:
"Good Morning Executive,

Please find attached the requested profitability analysis for the new line of business. Our findings illustrate that..."

Executive:
"thanks"
This is a repost, but your just trying to share a relatable meme with your fellow teens so take this upvote
As a high school teacher I sometimes try to respond with nice grammar and paragraphs, but then I look at my inbox and see my email from the other 180 students I have and 200 parents... and then I give up....
What‚Äôs the point in living?
I literally did this yesterday to a student
Even worse:


‚ÄúSure.‚Äù
[email like a boss](https://www.stayathomemum.com.au/work-at-home-ideas/10-phrases-to-use-to-write-emails-like-a-boss/)

Seriously, stop emailing like you're a piece of gum on somebody's shoe and write like you're the damn boss.

Thanks for keeping it short. Let me know if there are questions.
AND IF YOU DO THE SAME THING THEY CALL YOU DISRESPECTFUL AND PUT YOU IN DETENTION AND THAT DOESNT MAKE SENSE AND... sorry i just I just remembered a few things lol
Here‚Äôs a bit of advice from a college kid. Keep it quick. 

‚ÄúHello, Professor smith. 

I‚Äôve got a concern about our ECO 310-01 course. I‚Äôm not sure I understand the concept of supply side economics, and I was hoping you could help me. 

Can we please schedule a meeting during your office hours? I‚Äôm available from 12PM to 3PM MWF, and from 11AM through the rest of the day T/TH.

Thank you, 

Jos√© Garc√≠a‚Äù

Basically, address them professionally, split up your ideas into one sentence paragraphs, and say thanks. Professors have a lot of email to sort through, so they appreciate a succinct email.
I wish I received emails like that! Holy shit! Grammar! What the fuck is that!? None, absolutely none of the students I have encountered at the collegiate level can email properly. 

Seriously, use full sentences. It is like delicious cake to professors. If they do not reply in kind, politely remind them of email etiquette.
To be fair, that was probably the one email you sent that day and the 40th your teacher sent.
Maybe your teacher has 170 students, and they all email her to ask a question that she already answered in class 45 times?
Reasons I can think of:

* They have a ton more email to go through than you do. It's the reverse of the "every teacher gives 'only one hour ' of homework" problem.
* They're probably more used to emailing peers. My work emails go about like that.
* They're probably more used to emailing in general and don't see it as formally as you.
Teacher here, I experience the opposite often.
Ehh teachers probably have other stuff to do like marking homework and maybe worrying about their finances in the us
The president of the National Honor Society chapter in my school writes like that. It really seems like he knows what he's doing when he sends me an email that reads like a discord announcement.
Yes but if you do it the other way around they get mad at you for unprofessionalism
Hi. I teach college. Thank you for this reminder to give respect to get respect.
‚ÄúMultiple paragraphs‚Äù found the problem.
This is only relatable to some extent because it depends on what type of teacher. I see that most English teachers expect students to have formal writing in messaging, and obviously, their responses to students are usually written under formal writing as well. In the syllabus, my English professor states that formal communication is strictly expected when it comes to communicating with him through email. He strongly dislikes the 'social media language' that young people usually communicate. Words like "BTW" or "TTYL" or "THX" are prohibited in his class.

For me, personally, I'm not the kind of person who knows every social media language. Except for LOL and LMAO because I understand their meaning and I use them quite often. The rest is... I have no idea how to use them or what their meaning is. I'm also the kind of person who tends to write a long message for just a simple idea. It's like, for example, the topic is about asking my professor about my grade, and instead of writing one simple question, I write a whole, unnecessary paragraph, which I can aware that it can alter the main point of the message. Sometimes, writing needs to have some "informality" in order to create a simple and clear message.

On other hand, my Math professor often responds to my email with just one word or one simple sentence. If I ask her what is the due date for the assignment, her response would just be like, "Wednesday". Or if I express to her with my appreciation for her efforts in helping me solving the math problem, she would just reply "Thanks" with no further response to my deep, thoughtful words. That's a huge difference between her and my English professor. And like I said, it depends on the teacher.

PS If you have any questions about telescopes or space just lemme know, I‚Äôd be happy to help out :)
Bro, as a teen aspiring to be an astrophysicist, this is fucking amazing
Congrats man I didn‚Äôt see the original post but I‚Äôm proud
Hope you don't mind, but I'm a huge space nerd, and thought it'd be cool to give you some info about the part of the Moon you've photographed here! 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you've taken a pretty good picture of an area of the Moon around the surface feature Mare Humorum, which translates to the "Sea Of Moisture". It's an impact basin right around 420 km in diameter! It wasn't sampled by the Apollo Program, so we don't know how old it is, but it was considered as a landing sight for the last Apollo mission in 1972, Apollo 17. Based on observations though, we believe it could be right around 3.9 billion years old. It's also filled with a 3 km thick layer of basalt! 

Mare Humorum is actually very interesting to scientists because it can tell us about thermal evolution of that specific area of the Moon, and could give us clues about whether or not the Moon had some form of plate tectonics at one point, and how volcanically active the Moon was! Overall a great picture, you should do more!
Bruuuuuhhhhhhh so fucking epic!!

That is indeed a pretty badass picture of the moon!
maybe you could see where they landed!

HOLY FUCK IVE NEVER SEEN A PICTURE OF THE MOON SO CLEAR!!! Thank you so much OP this is amazing!!
I bought a telescope for my teenage daughter a few months ago and we‚Äôve had so much fun with it.  It‚Äôs amazing what you can see with a $400 telescope.  You should check out the [Great Globular Cluster](https://earthsky.org/clusters-nebulae-galaxies/m13-finest-globular-cluster-in-northern-skies).  It‚Äôs one of our favorites.  Star clusters in general are really cool.

Edit: Added link
Very cool!
Nice photo
Damn  
That's a badass picture of the night sky  
maybe the most badass picture of the night sky I've ever seen
So pretty!!!

Really beautiful picture by the way; it's the best picture of the moon i've seen. 
Curious question; what telescope did you buy?

Patience is a virtue

Thats really cool
Local58 got me scared of this picture
What telescope do you have? Right now I‚Äôm saving up for a 10 inch dob
Ok jokes aside can we just take a moment to thank all the other planets for bloking meteorites for us? We probably wouldn't be alive without their help! So, thanks Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, and all the others!
r/local58
This is crazy. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what telescope do you use? I was always fascinated with the stars and stuff like that
Great shot. What camera did you use?
This is kind of extremely beautiful and amazing

*The return of the Queen*
Are you a "girl"??

excuse me sir or ma'am but I couldn't help but notice.... are you a "girl"?? A "female?" A "member of the finer sex?" 

Not that it matters too much, but it's just so rare to see a girl around here! I don't mind, no--quite to the contrary! It's so refreshing to see a girl online, to the point where I'm always telling all my friends "I really wish girls were better represented on the internet."

And here you are!

I don't mean to push or anything, but if you wanted to DM me about anything at all, I'd love to pick your brain and learn all there is to know about you. I'm sure you're an incredibly interesting girl--though I see you as just a person, really--and I think we could have lots to teach each other. 

I've always wanted the chance to talk to a gorgeous lady--and I'm pretty sure you've got to be gorgeous based on your post--so feel free to shoot me a message, any time at all! You don't have to be shy about it, because you're beautiful anyways (that's juyst a preview of all the compliments I have in store for our chat).

Looking forwards to speaking with you soon, princess!

EDIT: I couldn't help but notice you haven't sent your message yet. There's no need to be nervous! I promise I don't bite, haha

EDIT 2: In case you couldn't find it, you can click the little chat button from my profile and we can get talking ASAP. Not that I don't think you could find it, but just in case hahah

EDIT 3: look I don't understand why you're not even talking to me, is it something I said?

EDIT 4: I knew you were always a bitch, but I thought I was wrong. I thought you weren't like all the other girls out there but maybe I was too quick to judge

EDIT 5: don't ever contact me again whore

EDIT 6: hey are you there?
New car and new merch damn you going all out this year
hoodie is good just dont milk this for upvotes
*i can milk you*


Edit: poor choice of words

He‚Äôs a hero and deserves to be treated as such
I said it before I'll say it again, Peter Wang deserves more respect than I am capable of giving. It fucks me up to think about the fact that its the heroes like him who go with less media recognition than the shooters themselves. I can't believe its already been a year since.
For those of you who dont know he was shot dead holding the door open for his classmates during a school shooting 
Could someone fill me in? I'd like to know more about this guy
Peter was a great guy to hang around, I used to sit with him at lunch and just talk. He always offered to help me on my algebra 1 homework because I didn‚Äôt pay attention in class. He was selfless and very respectful. I love you Peter and I hope they‚Äôre treating you well up there ‚ù§Ô∏è

edit:
edit2: edited out bc privacy 
"Its been 1 year already since Peter Wang died while attempting to save his fellow classmates" I feel like the title should be changed because he wasn't attempting to save his classmates, he **did** save his classmates. Not to nitpick.
Parkland was last year? WTF?
Why do all the good people in life have to become martyrs? He really didn‚Äôt deserve to die :( Rest In Peace Peter. You‚Äôre a role model and the textbook definition of selflessness.
The fact that people have been treating Cruz fairly well is fucking mind blowing to me. Shooting up a school and killing many innocent students and teachers is something that should make one eligible for the death penalty.
What a hero, you will be missed.
make this man number one again
I remember coming to class one day to learn that out art teacher wouldn't be teaching at our school anymore. Apparently their son or very close cousin ( I don't remember ) was one of the people killed at the shooting and she was super emotionally distressed about the situation (which she should be!). 

Stoneman Douglass isn't that far from where I live and it really did hit home when I know 3 different people directly affected by the shooting that lost someone close or a friend. More that were there that day sharing what it was like. 

It's different hearing it from people you know about a school shooting than on the news.. 
True hero
Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero. 
I wanna say F as respectful as possible.  but all I can really say is good job peter. 
A hero 
Rest in Peace, Peter

respect brother thank you op for posting and keeping his name alive. We all die twice, once when we pass away and another when you're last thought about. We'll never forget his name and his sacrifice

There was literally an attempted school shooting at MY high school today. Thank the higher power everyone made it out alive. A level of altruism we can only hope to reach. Rest easy Mr. Wang.
Rest In Peace. He really did a great job. Instead running out like everybody, he decided to help his classmates. My condolences go out to his whole family. Rest In Peace man.
this guy was a hero. Rest In Peace, legend.
i drove by a church today with rows of desks sitting outside, each one with a name. i learned that it was the victims of this same school shooting. this kid is such a hero and he deserves to be remembered.
Peter Wang, you are a REAL hero. You will live on inside all those who knew you and all those who know your story. 
It's a goddamn shame. I think he wore his JROTC uniform proudly and upheld the virtues he strove to live by in doing so.

The community as a whole really lost a promising young man that day, a true hero. 
He did not deserve to die, no teenagers killed school shootings deserved to die. School shootings have become a norm now and it needs to stop.
Rest in peace Peter! Thank you for being a hero
I remember this day too clearly. I got home, ate a chocolate bar my mom gave me, got on my PS4 and joined a friend's party. He immediately sends me a screenshot of a tweet breaking the news. At first, I thought it was a sick joke or a doctored tweet. After several minutes of arguing on why he would send that, I finally decided to search it up for myself. It hit too hard. I live 20 minutes away from Stoneman Douglas. #MSDStrong. Rest In Peace Peter, I may have never met you, but I will always know who you were.

Rest in peace Peter. What a hero. üíô

May Allah put him on the path to heaven! That‚Äôs what really matters. The afterlife. In Islam, ‚ÄúSomeone who kills another human is like killing the entire human race, and whosoever saves a life is like saving the entire human race‚Äù. 

Qur‚Äôan - 5:32 

He indeed will be thanked in the afterlife. 
Good hearted and doesn‚Äôt deserve to be forgotten 
He laid down his life so others could live theirs. He has my respect for eternity. Rest In Peace 
Mad fucking respect, a true hero. He will be missed.
Didn't attempt, hero saved countless lives. He held the door open while everyone else ran. 
Rest in peace to an honorable hero. Fly high up there.

Damn one of my exes 4 year old brother used to call me "big brother", hurt to know I wouldn't see him anymore when we broke up
Yeah man one of my first relationships ended up with me becoming great friends with her little brother even after she cheated on me, lied, stole from me and attempted to blackmail me. I still talk to him every now and then and it warms my heart knowing that every time I do it upsets her :)
My ex's little sister absolutely loved me when he and I were together. Learned recently that two years later she STILL asks about me. Shit hurts man

EDIT: Since someone can't read, I meant my ex bf's little sister. She's like 8 or 9 now and ngl, I miss her more than I miss him. He was a prick to me and her and all she ever wanted was to have an older sister figure. I wish I still had some sort of contact with that lil shit

Small update: I got back in touch with my ex (for no reason other than he sent me a meme) and his sister remembers me. She's 8 now and any time he brings up any girl he's friends with she asks if it's me. I'm going to see her today lmao
Damn you this actually hurt my feelings.
Man... I came to laugh and want to hate myself; now I am just sad. My ex‚Äôs little brother saw me as a brother. I was teaching him guitar and giving him tips for playing the saxophone when we broke up. He seems to be doing pretty good for himself, but man... I miss those days when I came over and would just chat with him. He was asking her all the time when we would get married. Broke my heart to think how that affected him.
Holy fuck. Currently in a relationship and she has two little brothers which love to play MineCraft and smash with me. My gf told me her brothers constantly ask her if she's gonna marry me when we grow up, not even our parents put that much pressure jajaja
[deleted]
The answer is always yes unless they are little turds
I was the cause for the 10 year old little brother of my ex to start playing videogames, 1 year since we broked up and I still play videogames with him every now and then after he asked me this exact same question, he is actually really good in APEX Legends, I'm so proud of him :')
"come over to my house"  

"cant, coronavirus"  

"my parents arent home"  

"so?"  

"my little bro needs help beating the ender dragon"  

\*zooms off at the speed of light\*
I wish I could wipe my memory and watch zabuzas death again that shit was sad
Bro too real...
I miss u Matthias. You a real homie
When my ex cheated on me and broke up, my little sister who really looked up to her cried probably as much as me. That was garbage
I'm sorry young naruto
OMG HOLY SHIT THIS ONE HURT
your words cut deep
Still stay in contact with her, JUST SO THAT YOU CAN PLAY VIDEO GAMES WITH HER LITTLE BROTHER. It's both a power move and wholesome.
My friend went through this with his last ex. Shit is devastating. Low key glad my ex was the youngest in her family.
One of the things I miss the most about being with my ex boyfriend are his little sisters. They‚Äôre going to be 15 this year and I miss them like crazy. Felt like my own sisters. Plus they are smart and cool as fuck. I take comfort in knowing they will achieve and do a lot with their lives as long as they become emotionally healthy and learn how to form secure attachments.
A girl I used to be friends with was pretty much only friends with girls, so when I came over her dad was excited to see me because I was the only boy that came over. We were total homies. I miss him so much :(
Rip Zabuza and Haku ;((
I feel you bro, 4 months already and I still miss my ex‚Äôs family
:( I... I'm n-not g.. G.. go-ona cry YOU a a... are
Its hard to relate when u don't have a girlfriend
I was that younger brother
I get messages from my exes little brother every time at Sunday on Xbox when he‚Äôs allowed on I play with him time to time
Wow that‚Äôs nice my exes little brother said are you going to touch anymore ? Ps I wonder why she broke up with me. Beats me.
fuck dude. you just reminded me of my exes family, they were great people and I was totally enamored with her little brother. he was the only boy, 7 years old, in a family of 4 girls, their mother and father and he really looked up to me. he loved talking with me about super heroes always asking me who would win and hed talk about how he loved endgame and infinity war. I really loved that kid and I miss him a lot. he probably hates me now cus I wouldnt put it past that chick to tell her family I was basically satan
This hurt in the meme and it hurt in the anime
Nooooo. I broke up with a boy and my little brother cried forever when I broke the news that his friend wouldn‚Äôt be returning.
I am feeling sad for Haku
Fuck you at least give credit to the guy who posted this first in r/dankruto. Also RIP Zabuza
Don‚Äôt do this to him, he did nothing to you
Brother or not the boy would be a friend. Always down for a friend


However such a scenario which you mentioned is impossible
u/repostsluethbot
Right in the feels. Not cool, man! 
I was with my ex husband for 10 years. In those 10 years, his little brother was born and his sister was in elementary school. I used to babysit them both and helped raise his little brother. I gave boyfriend and makeup advice to his little sister and we'd dance to Hannah Montana. I cried when she came down dressed for her first prom. I played video games, ball games, watched cartoons, did fun crafts, and made him fun lunches like hot dogs shaped like octopuses with his little brother. My ex ended cheating on me multiple times, but I forgave him until he handed me divorce papers. Saying goodbye to his little sister who was in 11th grade last time I saw her was devastating. Saying goodbye to his little brother was worse. He was 9 and didn't understand I was never coming back. He kept saying "don't worry, we'll play next week". I still miss them both like they were my family. Ex married his affair partner and I hope to God she treats them like her own siblings. I hope they still think about me.
My ex girlfriend cousin and I share names. The best part is that it‚Äôs a pretty uncommon one in my country. That girl is condemned to always say my name.
RIP Zabuza and Haku dude fuck
My exes older brother and I never really played video games but we had the same interest in them &amp; we'd talk about them. It sucks that we split though because I thought of him as somewhat of a friend.
I was the little brother once. We played one last game. We occasionally text. He was great.
My older brother was going out with this girl who was bat shit crazy and he was friends with her older brother and when my brother broke up with his ex he stayed friends with her brother. This girl kinda isolated herself from people for a while and was weird for ages after and said she didn‚Äôt have any friends now that he broke up with her, which wasn‚Äôt true. 


Also he has a new girlfriends and he says she kinda crazy as well. I swear he must just like the crazys
r/wholesomedepression
man, I was the little brother here years back
Ive never been in a relationship before but reading this made me sad
Tbh if my ex has a good relationship with my sibling I wouldn‚Äôt mind being friends or at least civil with him for the sake of my siblings friendship
My ex has a slightly younger sister and a much younger brother.
Because family has always been a broken concept for me, the family I found in my ex was very meaningful for me. 

I loved being lil dude‚Äôs older brother. We would play Smash a lot, and sometimes I‚Äôd kick the shit out of him. Sometimes he‚Äôd destroy me. 
I could tell how isolated and misunderstood he felt sometimes. He would receive some very unfair treatment from his family sometimes, and as an outsider, I could see it in a way they couldn‚Äôt. I could relate to him too.

I would often follow him as he stormed out to console him and be his confidant. I really love him. It‚Äôs been a few months now... and I really hope who my ex is with now hasn‚Äôt *replaced* me. 

(Note: he‚Äôs a happy boy. He loves his family. He is not an abused child. He‚Äôs a young boy living in a matriarchal family, getting into his teenage years. He has normal frustrations, and those in charge have some blind spots. Please do not get concerned for him, he has a bright future and a good present.)

Me and the sister were freaking chums too! She is autistic, and therefore faces many struggles socially. She can be very accidentally antagonistic at times, but it is so rewarding to be there when she‚Äôs comfortable. She‚Äôs hilarious and an absolute delight, constantly asking to play Minecraft with me lol

I have nightmares about my ex and sometimes her boyfriend almost every night. Our separation has been incredibly hard on me. But, fortunately, not so hard for her.
I would cross the hottest, most arid desert for all of them.
I‚Äôve never even had a girlfriend but this struck a feel
My ex‚Äôs little brother was kinda crazy but a super fun kid I still miss him
Omg I was the little brother one time.
I talked to the ex-bc for the first time in years last week to play some Valorant
most successful repost I‚Äôve ever seen 

Stolen from r/dankruto
Shit this hurts more than the actual breakup.
Probably cos the little bro/sis wasn‚Äôt involved and just got caught in the fallout.
I play with my crush's little brother a lot, i talk to my crush a lot too, but i never told her i like her, im too ugly whiles shes beautiful, so i dont think she likes me back, sometimes it hurts thinking about it, but i have to accept :(
Wow you had the heart to post this
Congratulations! You are absolutely incredible!

I had heart surgery when I was born. Everyone asks me about the scars at football practice every day. Also I thought it was a picture and it scared me when it started moving. Great job on surviving
I'm going for heart surgery in 7 months or so, so  congrats for the gigantic milestone you just passed. Glad to know you are good

Congratulations really, my best friend passed away last year just hours after a "successful " heart operation and things just really haven't been very well for me since so its nice to see that at least you made it! Congratulations and i hope you live a full and happy life.
Congratulations! I hope you have a smooth recovery. 

Also r/foundfelix
That must have been unpleasant
Ouch, my heart hurts just looking at you.
Oh my god you are so brave!! Congratulations and speedy recovery
Man, I would‚Äôve died slowly and said no. 


You are a braver soul than I. Surgery is one of my worst fears
congrats man! didja get to keep the old one (assuming it was a transplant)?
You did, you crazy motherfuckrr you did it.
Hey man god to see that you‚Äôre alright. Stay on that grind
Hey I have a similar condition called AFib. They are attributing this to possibly the wolff one. Brings on ludicrous speed heart rate with no rhthym. 

I'm on a waiting list for a catheter ablation (Yay free healthcare).  Just wondering if this is the same procedure you got, if it was terrifying or any details you're willing to share about the process. 

Thanks and hope you heal up fast.
Yooooo! We can be Heart surgery bros. Hell ya
Congrations!
Congrats, I myself survived heart surgery about 8 months ago. You have a fight ahead of you to get strong again. 
Here‚Äôs to the challenge, I think you got this.
I didn't.

The most embarrising thing is that this is the second time im doing home learning. A second wave occurred in my country just after we started going back
My school gave us the option to stay at home but you go to classes through zoom. So like there‚Äôs a camera in the classroom.
What about waking up I gotta wake up at 6:30 and now I normally wake at around 10:30

Hi. Teacher here from r/all. 

We are scared too. 

We don‚Äôt have many answers either. 

We miss you. 

We‚Äôre doing everything in our power to make this year tolerable. 

You guys are doing something unprecedented and honestly brave. But this generation is something else. You guys have social media so not being in person doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt interact with friends. Please embrace the internet during this time. 

Also, be easy on us. We know you don‚Äôt want to do this. We know it‚Äôs weird and stressful. We may mess up. Please go easy on us and we‚Äôll return that energy. 

Lastly, it will be okay. Be smart. Wear a mask, distance yourselves. Carry sanitizer with you. And if it isn‚Äôt okay? We are here for you. Trust me, your teachers will LOVE if you reach out to them just to talk, even if theyre busy. One of my favorite things about this job is getting to know my students. 

You guys are special. And that‚Äôs how I know you‚Äôre going to be so successful this year, even if the world around you is failing you.
Currently just listening to my teacher tell us shit. I dont have to show my face just yet...
Things I will miss: Getting to be healthy and safe.

I'm going into highschool. To my advantage, I have a very loud puppy who's cage is in my room + my bird likes to scream when people are on phone calls. Somebody starts being loud, I get asked to mute my mic, boom.

Lol I did home school for about 6 years and probably only shown my face on Cam twice
It was my fist day back and everyone is coughing
WHY REPOST?!!!!!
You can't miss it if you're not alive
I do. Things here have calmed down almost to a halt and normal life practically back again but with masks
Are you kidding yeah school sucks but the only good part was dicking around with your friend group. Now all we have is the shit part. I can't wait to go back to normal.
I‚Äôm not a teen so don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm allowed here lol but I saw this on my popular feed and just have to say this. I‚Äôm really sorry any of you guys have to actually go back to in person school and risk catching this virus, good luck to all of you and stay safe
I miss my friends
Edit: I don't have friends
I'll miss life the most
I go back in two days, no forced masks or distancing. Different year groups slowly come in until were all in by friday. Big oop
my dad has said on multiple occasions that nobody will die, or get it. one week in and students have it and a teacher has died...
yep, apparently we have to do everyday a test to see if we get positive it‚Äôs a terrible idea not to go online class again and well my school starts in 3 days so
I Started today and now everyone obligatory has have there cams on, and now everyone has to see my broken sleep schedule face, I‚Äôm still online tho.
And I'll miss using Reddit for 12 hrs
Hell no, the schools must not be opened now, this will be the end of the world if they do.
Wait are American schools opening as well? That sounds like an awful idea. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt go because I do not want to risk that much with 50,000+ new cases per day. I‚Äôm much more comfortable to go back to school in the uk but still a bit cautious.
Well UK is about to hit a second wave so no school- delayed exams...
Yeah, i still remember talking in discord calls while in class with my buddy who was also in the same class  and we were talking about how in the school trip he took a gulp of my evergy drink without me knowing and i wanted to be sure how he did it so i just fucken went on paint and did a shitty drawing of him and stairs and then the paint shutty drawings kept going
Anyone else's school start on the 17th of August?
last time I wasn‚Äôt required to turn on my camera but now I‚Äôm forced to and I hate it because I‚Äôve just let myself get ugly all quarantine on top of me being ugly to start with.
Unpopular opinion: I‚Äôm gonna do online again cause my grades have gone up stupid amounts because I actually am able to concentrate and my mental health has improved
Imagine going back to school

It's a dumb meme but back when I was in school I was reading a lot oh pirated ebooks and whenever I'd come across a word I wasn't familiar with I'd just right-click it and hit "search Google".

Well anyway it got to the point where I'd be reading an analog book and would try and do it as well.

Good times.

I love you Billie, we could have been together, think about it! 
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it!

I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me...

my sister says that teenagers in politics are always getting shut down but when I try to talk about politics, which are opposing to hers, she says ‚Äúshut up you‚Äôre only 14‚Äù

edit: to clarify my sister is 16
I honestly hate the "teenager" stereotype.
I love it when I have disagreeing political views with someone, and they are work to shit me down even more
Agree 100%. If it makes you feel any better, "adults" tell each other that they don't know what they're talking about, even more than they say it to teenagers. No one is allowed to think for themselves, apparently
When is it my turn to repost this for a few thousand upvotes?
‚ÄúCan you not be posted, for FIVE MINUTES‚Äù
Can everybody stop posting this? It‚Äôs been reposted on this sub countless times.
Yes
Once I was talking with my friends about some of these things at mall and this older woman came up to us and said "you're all pretty smart for your age" That really made my day
Old people are always going to complain. Honestly I couldn‚Äôt care less, but there‚Äôs a reason that the ‚Äúteenagers don‚Äôt know anything‚Äù stereotype exists. Most teenagers don‚Äôt really think for themselves yet and base their opinions on whatever the media says.
Unless you agree with them
I often talk about the first parts and when I do people seem to listen, I haven‚Äôt heard the bottom part in like 6 months
Mom said it's my turn to repost this.
This gets reposted every week
You are supposed to act as an adult!

Teenager: \*acts as an adult\*

Oh shut up you are just a kid
all of those topics are ones that impact teens and their future as a generation, so they have the right to speak about those things ‚Äî as long as they don‚Äôt spread hate while doing so, and they do try to educate themselves on topics they are ignorant on so they don‚Äôt spread around false information.
(edit: wording)
Teenagers talking about the issues that actually concern them and will affect their lives growing up? Preposterous, how DARE they! I can‚Äôt believe how insolent those youngins are these days.
[deleted]
Partly true. Teenagers don‚Äôt know what they are talking about most of the time. Doesn‚Äôt mean you shut them down when they are trying to discuss/ learn more about the subject..
"This is a fair request, and I promise I will not judge any person only as a teenager. You will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation judges people by their race, their belief, or the color of their skin, and that this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken dope-addicts or glue-sniffers." - Victor Lundberg

30 year old here (sorry for being on the wrong sub). Keep talking, keep being involved, participating. We love it. You guys have brains like sponges and we need your super powers.
Non-teenager here. Expect to be treated like this until you're in your mid-thirties to early forties because bringing up youth and inexperience is a typical way for people who don't like your views to invalidate those views. There's no line where you become "experienced enough" there's just a line where they know they can't get away with using that excuse anymore.
Ok but in all seriousness, allowing teenagers to be the faces of nationwide political movements is a bad experiment and will have terrible consequences for both the teenagers‚Äô mental health and the civility of the country. 

First of all, children being made into celebrities in any context is terrible for them. Additionally, being made famous in a political context, where you‚Äôre subjected to much more scrutiny (and rightly so) can have nothing but negative consequences for that person‚Äôs mental health. 

Second of all, the teenage brain is not prepared to lead a civil discourse (coming from an 18 year old). The reason why is that teenagers are not yet developed enough to really understand perspectives that contradict the narrative they‚Äôve constructed, and they usually aren‚Äôt emotionally equipped to admit when they‚Äôre wrong. When you‚Äôre a baby, they say that you can‚Äôt comprehend the idea of things happening beyond your perception. When you‚Äôre a toddler, you assume that everyone is looking at the world from your eyes. What we can get from this is, the more mature you are, the more you realize the size of the world in relation to yourself. By the time someone is 16, they fully grasp the concept of things happening outside their perception. However, they still aren‚Äôt fully there yet. When teenagers first get into politics, they see it as an exciting new world to take part in. When they first formulate their opinions, they immediately become emotionally invested in said opinions. And, they usually argue from the assumption, ‚Äúmy opinions are the right opinions. I know what‚Äôs best for everyone, and if everybody would just shut up and do everything I do and say everything I say, all the world‚Äôs problems would be solved‚Äù. This mentality is also why teenagers are more likely to support radical and authoritarian ideas. 

In short, maturity is all about understanding the size of the world in relation to yourself. And, politics is all about maturity. It‚Äôs about being able to understand and to empathize with the perspectives of people who think differently than you. 

None of this is to demoralize or mock teenagers. The arrogant phase I described is a perfectly normal phase that everyone goes through. But, to take someone who is still in that phase and turn them into a person of influence can only have negative consequences for everyone.

Could someone not repost this every 3 days? Thanks
It do be like that
Importance is subjective.
My good sir take this silver god I love this sub Reddit!
Yea, being a teen sucks. It‚Äôs an in between stage where you‚Äôre too young to be trusted but too old to do childish things. It‚Äôs bullshit.
Also adults: 18 is a fine age to go and die for your country.  
Also also adults: 18 is way too young to drink or smoke.
I hate when my classmates talk about politics because they are usually saying the same things that they heard from their parents. It's really annoying.
We live in a society.
No you know what you‚Äôre talking about, when you‚Äôre agreeing with them.
If someone‚Äôs argument to your political ideas is your age, then their not very good at debate and it‚Äôs not worth your time. It‚Äôs one of the people who just blindly follow what people say.
I honestly hate this garbage. Which teenagers actually don't talk about issues like this? I mean just when me and my friends were talking about gun safety. Teenagers have to be taken more seriously overall
Shitty adults are terrified of you, because they can feel in their bones that they are a dying breed. I work with many teenagers, and I think gen z is fantastic. Overall, so many teens I've worked with are politically aware, passionate, accepting, and so done with this bullshit. Go get those bastards. Eat 'em alive.
Big fucking fax

But, there are some ppl out there who simply

*Do not* 

Know what the fuck they're talking about
The average teenager: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt really care‚Äô.

The average adult: ‚Äòagree with me or I‚Äôll come to your house and murder u in your sleep u Brain Dead FUCKER!!!‚Äô.
The ability to pretend to listen to someone's view is a useful one though
As someone who actually knows their shit when it comes to politics, most of you retards don't know what the fuck you're talking about
this is so true
"they don't do anything with their lives they are so lazy they watch OTHER PEOPLE play video games"
"oh you kids are too young to talk about that stuff just enjoy life while your a teenagerrrr"
StOp wRiTiNg lIkE tHis
My opinion on all of these: feminism is needed on third world countries. Political correctness has become stupidly censoring. We don't need too much of it. Racism will always exist because people are afraid of the different but that doesn't include radical racism (nazis and ISIS) - only low-key racism. Far left is the same with the far right. Anarchy is fucking retarded. And this goes for communism and fascism (+nazism) too. White straight males are not bad and the fat acceptance movement is doing wrong.
The difference is bills
I found the original video of the top one and its literally a guy crying about how good his weed is


I didnt know that before and it was so funny
i mean, we do spent up to 6 to 7 hours a day at school with no pay so a job kind of feels like school with less hours only except you get paid.
Lmao yes, I work at McDonald's and even tho I make chump change it feels like a fortune to my broke ass
cant wait to be able to buy a thing
Minimum wage would be a fucking raise to me
Not to brag, but I have *-26$ in debt*
You get paid a phat paycheck at mcdonalds though
24 y/o twitch streamers when mr beast donates 100k
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm fucking 2 months into my senior year and still don‚Äôt have a job I‚Äôve wanted one since my sophomore year and my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me even try to get one until this August and literally everything has fallen through there‚Äôs nowhere that will hire me here everywhere you have to have experience which is impossible if no one hires me I hate this stupid ass town
30 year old working at McDonald's

19yr olds working at McDonald's
Anyone else picture themselves in the 70s making minimum wage and can buy shit like they're making 18dollars an hour nowadays.
Context: I deliver pizza 

Me when I get into my car and plug in the aux: *Pizza Time*
Haha jokes on you, my 13 year old thinks that minimum wage is $20/hour. I'm going to let him learn it the hard way.
I think it's kids when they're paid
Repost please stop
Minimum wage with no bills to pay and no pressure to buy anything expensive like a house or save for retirement is pretty decent.

Plus usually the jobs teens work are low pressure mundane labor.
I legit spent a month as a kid getting fat off mcdonalds drinking shamrock shakes on the daily. Probably better for my own health and my wallet that they don't serve them where I live now.
45 bucks an hour here

That was my flex carry on
My salary is 0 dollars
Isn‚Äôt it in some states that they can pay you like $3.40 an hour for your first 6 months working at a place if you‚Äôre under 18.
You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. I wager you couldn't empty a boot of excrement were the instructions on the heel. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half-baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective. You are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame. You have nothing to say, and Godwin's Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet. I don't like you. I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done. I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I wretch at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are deficient in all that lends character. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go. You are a fiend, coward, degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly, deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent, contemptible, criminal, fascistic, bigoted, racist, sexist, avaricious, tasteless, idiotic, brain-damaged, imbecilic, insane, arrogant, deceitful, demented, lame, self-righteous, byzantine, conspiratorial, satanic, fraudulent, bilious, splenetic, spastic, ignorant, clueless, illegitimate, harmful, destructive, dumb, evasive, double-talking, devious, revisionist, narrow, manipulative, paternalistic, fundamentalist, dogmatic, idolatrous, unethical, cultic, diseased, suppressive, controlling, restrictive, malignant, deceptive, dim, crazy, weird, dystrophic, stifling, uncaring, plantigrade, grim, unsympathetic, jargon-spouting, censorious, secretive, aggressive, mind-numbing, abrasive, poisonous, flagrant, self-destructive, abusive, and socially-retarded. I will never forget you. Your interaction with me is now burned into my psyche. As I recalled our horrid interaction, my whole body shook in disgust and I broke into a permanent frenzy of anger and confusion--i feel retarded. What you told me was undisputedly the dumbest combination of words uttered in the entire world. Allow yourself to decompose to aid the surrounding flora in replacing the oxygen your stupid fucking skull wastes on a daily basis. I'm fucking disgusted at the fact that you exist on the same planet as me, and what is worse is that you share similar dna to me. The fact that our DNA is connected, even marginally, is anabomination and I am going to spiral into a depression very quickly because of this realization. The realization that we both fall under the term "human" and I have to be grouped in with your pathetic existence is disgraceful. I am very traumatized by you. Your body language is fucking atrocious and it bothers me to no end. It's so pathetic, the way you mope around. You mope around with your shoulders hunched over, lethargically dragging your feet on the floor. You have a thin, fragile frame. You walk around reacting to everything that happens to you. Fuck you. There are horrible, inexcusable things that I would happily do to never interact with you again, even if it was for a brief moment. I will explain what these things are in a list format, because that's the only way your 7-year old brain stuck in a man's body will understand it. I would rather withdraw all my money in cash from my multiple bank accounts, get it all together and poop on it, give myself big papercuts in all the crevices of my fingers and proceed to dip my hands in salt water, stub my big toe over 50 times in one day, be told by someone in authority that I will never amount to anything in my life, ever, be a LITERAL cuckold, get bitch-slapped by a man with rough hands once a day, for every day of my life going forward, undergo dramatic negative changes in my lifestyle that would damage my mind and body beyond repair, undergo a whole host of different forms of mental and physical humiliation; as in being spat on and told I am worthless, be forced to drink non-alcoholic macro-produced beer from the can, while every person around me drinks Trappist beers from exotic chalices for 10 hours straight - for the rest of my life, have a procedure done to reduce my IQ so that my new IQ falls within the range of down syndrome.

&amp;#x200B;

...than engage in the briefest of interactions with you.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no sympathy for you. I feel bad for myself for being forced to interact with you. Its bullshit that you are conscious and had to be in my vision. I will never recover from this - you have single-handedly jaded my view of the world and made me very hopeless and cynical. I have been violently puking in 20 minute intervals due to your worthlessness. You're character is so devoid of any charisma that the only thing to do to would be to force you to change via bullying. You are a moronic human being after all things are considered. Don't you dare stop reading my long insult that I am hurling towards you. Don't even think of skimming over even a small portion of it. You need to peruse my long personal attack towards you with great intensity, and take all the hurtful things I have said about you very seriously and personally. The pain and suffering that I have been forced to endure due to you having briefly crossed paths with me has been excruciating. You put such little effort into thinking about your words, its almost as if you farted them out of your mouth. While you do this, your posture looks as if there is extra gravity weighing your down - so much so, that you look as if you're drowning in a bog all the time. Struggling to make it out of the bog with each step you take. I harbor such deep feelings of pity for myself that I now consider myself to be less fortunate than a diseased homeless person - all because I interacted with you for an extremely brief moment. The length of our interaction was so short that if it was an interaction with anyone else for the same amount of time, I would have forgotten about it incredibly quickly and wouldnt have even been able to recall the basic premise of the interaction. However, since it was you, this interaction could and should be deemed as a crime against humanity. I will demand my doctor to prescribe me a cocktail of antipsychotic meds, xanax, ketamine, and barbiturates. I will be talking large amounts of each of the aforementioned drugs at the same time in hopes of offering me fleeting symptoms of mild relief from the trauma you have caused by claiming memes as your own.
Literally spent my first money made on a big mac
I'm paid under minimum wage üòé
This is reposted from r/dankmemes really old one too
I calculated it and with minimum wage subtracting car insurance I‚Äôd have about 15$ a month

Ive come to a conclusion from most of the shit i see on this sub that EVERY fucking teenager   
must has the worst and most terrible parents ever

OR

teens are fucking little shits who do nothing but shit on those who prolly love them the most

either way this sub is cancer
Saw the same meme on r/insaneparents and it was a better quality, don't try and claim it as yours that's just rude, I'd link it but I'm on mobile.

You don‚Äôt remember anything and it‚Äôs so sudden, almost as if you took a nap. [Here‚Äôs an article about it](https://www.healthline.com/health/epilepsy/absence-petit-mal-seizures)
This is school in general
Finally someone who gets it
Im in this picture and i hate it
Everytime!
Me: looks down to write down the problem

5 seconds later

Teacher: So, does anyone have the answer?

Me:\*mentally\* who could be done yet?

rest of the class: \*raises hand with answer\*

Me: \*tries to disappear into the void\*
I do addmath, it's 10x worse.
Watching this meme while on a break in a maths class.
a = b

a^2 = ab

a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2

(a + b)(a - b) = b(a - b)

(a + b) = b

2b = b

2 = 1
HL math but you never closed your eyes

Ah yes, difference of squares. Functions gang rise up
Man, I wish if I could reward you, but sorry I don't have Reddit money.

Also it is relatable.
Learning is good, but school is shit
Me: Ok this is important I have to pay attention right now

Also me: *proceeds to get distracted and miss everything the teacher says*
Hey you, your finally aw- 

#WAKE UP...
no all i see is abababab2babzyzanababab2
wait.. u can pay attention in math?
I chose to stay at the second image
Dude, math is easy. It's just counting with extra steps
AP Calculus gang rise up
The one before he closes his eyes is also hard
then you‚Äôre like ‚Äúwell shit I can‚Äôt join in till I get it, gotta wait for next unit‚Äù

WE ARE SO BEHIND TODAY
Sadly I'm very easily distracted
Nice new use of this guy's facial expression.
Oh my god thank you so much. Math class is on a low for me right now and just that you posted this made me feel so much better
The one time u don't pay attention but then the teacher asks you a question so you pretend you understand
I‚Äôm not trying to gatekeeper or anything but this gets exponentially worse in college.
Currently I'm retaking calculus online, as an adult, at my own pace.  The things that I'm able to grasp is far deeper than I was able to do when I was in high school and college because I'm able to stop, make sure I rewatch videos and redo homework, and memorize the things that I'm having issue recalling.

We have all of the technological know-how to build the schools that take advantage of this model, with self-testing, as something called 'mastery learning'.  You don't ever fall behind, you simply are where you're at, with the expectation that you improve and teachers there to help lead you through the stickier parts of the journey.

Things like English, philosophy, etc. can still be done the 'classic' way.  I personally believe that these classes should be rebuilt to help understand the subject matter, and to develop your own life philosophies, and not be so severely graded.
I missed a few days of pre calculus and when i came back i understood absolutely nothing so i decided to skip class for the rest of the year. Yeah, social anxiety is a bitch
History class*
Anyone else in math readin this rn?
My distraction is copying what the teacher wrote on the board while she's explaining the next thing but i can't listen to her because i'm copying the first thing and if i don't do it now she won't let me enough time to copy it. Viscious circle of confusion.
Can't relate. My teachers are on strike at the moment
How long we talking here? 69.420 picoseconds?
And you get a bad grade thx to that
Then the teacher wipes the board half a second later
Jokes on you my teacher write them on the computer and then gives to us in paper sheet :3
And when you open your eyes it switched to history.
Fuck that factorising shit
It's especially worse with ADHD. I'll get distracted thinking about something thats probably not important and when I look back at the board this happens

Yo, I wanna share this on my school's insta meme page, could you spell your username in lowercase so I know which letters are lowercase "L" and which are uppercase "i"

Why is a teenager drawing and colouring in history class?
Jefferson, J. Adams, and Washington weren‚Äôt around to sign the declaration I don‚Äôt think. Washington was in NY because he was only recently chosen as commander of the continental army, and Jefferson and Johnny boy were in Europe.

He did?!!!! NNOOO
He was the best in that show.

#RIP
When?
We lost a real one, bois...
Man 2020 just keeps getting worse.
The sad part is that someone already changed all the ‚Äúis‚Äùs to ‚Äúwas‚Äù
First Jessi and now Grant :(
I hate 2020 with a burning passion unlike anything I've ever felt before in my entire fucking life.
I loved watching that show growing up, it's sad to see him go so early. At least he made a legacy for himself before his death. He will be remembered by all of us.
I legit just saw an IG post with him in it a few hours ago.
#Fuck you 2020

###RIP Mr. Imahara
i grew up watching mythbusters this literally broke my heart
When i was younger and that show was one of the only shows i could watch all day all night and seeing him died makes me feel sad
my girlfriend just told me about this and it made me so sad,, he absolutely was such a part of my childhood with that show. it's so goddamn sad to see him go now :,(
Why do all Grants involved in science die!?
Wtf 2020
For f sake. No!!!! He is one of my childhood heroes. Gone but not forgotten.
Keep me updated please. I want to know how asap.
RIP to a true legend
Fuck me. I grew up watching him. RIP you legend amongst men.
I‚Äôm shocked, confused and sad üò≠üò≠üò≠ RIP Grant
So many good memories. May he rest in peace
HE'S ONLY 49 WTF HAPPENED!
Nooooooooooo
My dad directed myth busters. Can we please spread the positivity and defend Adam Savage against the unjust accusations going against him
Rest In Peace, I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know much about him other than the fact that he was in mythbusters...
So long partner
I leaned today that he was a head engineer for r2d2
:(
Damn, I'm actually really sad to hear that. Mythbusters was my favourite show
Noooü•∫
I dont know who that is, but rest in peace my guy
Wait how did he die
It's too soon he was one of my favourite myth busters and he will be missed dearly by all of us
Such a shame, he was always one of my favourites on the show and he was taken from us too soon.
He is one of the men responsible for the Star Wars Prequels and Mythbusters. RIP MAN
He was a fantastic person. That‚Äôs really sad
Man, this is one of the first celebrity deaths that has really hit me. Rest in peace, Grant.
Just saw this on r/prequelmemes. The dude apparently worked on R2D2 and other droids.
We've had like five other celebrities die in the past week or so, but this is the only one I know and the only one that affects me. It's really sad to see him go, especially at that age.
Oh, motherfucker.
Oh my god, no!
2020 is truly the worst year yet
Man wtf else is 2020 going to take away from us?
Sad.


Let's find an affordable innovative solution to screen for unruptured aneurysms, so that we may prevent this awful death as much as we can try to.
He also operated R2D2 in Star Wars.
#Ok, 2020, you had your fun, but that's too much
I rarely get sad to the point of tears by strangers passing, but this guy was a hero and meant a lot to me growing up.
Man this fucking year sucks rip
Bruh this ruined my day, I remember turning the dstv decoder at 8pm every school day and watching it with my brother when we were small, thx Imahara for the memories
Holy shit that's sad, died young as fuck.

Also to yall making racist as fuck comments or saying "F" or "20 more years he would've died at a NICE age" you can go fuck yourself. This man was an absolute legend, everyone on the mythbusters crew was a legend. They all brought something to the table upon joining the show and you cant even show the slightest of respect for a guy who died at a young af age? Yall niggas eome genuine disappointment and disgraces to the human race.
How did he die
I swear to God if anyone right F in the comments I will snap.
Oh no
FUCK
This is a sad day.
FUCK
2020 has gone too far...
Aw shit we lost another one QwQ
Damn that sucks. I used to watch a lot of Mythbusters back when it was a thing. Rest in peace
Yeah. He will forever be in my mind. I remember being young and watching mythbusters. That‚Äôs what I remember him from. He was really cool too.  
Knowing that he died is really sad for me. May he rest in peace.
As someone who has seen ever episode of myth busters this is the worst news I‚Äôve heard in a long time
Mythbusters was my first inspiration and insight into mechanics and to this day, at 16. I'm still following that dream. Thank you grant. Thank you Jessi.
You were real good son maybe even the best
he also operated R2-D2 for the Star Wars Prequels! a real legend
NO!!!! this year sucks big fat donkey balls
Fucking hell. This year...
this is the worst thing of 2020, and that seemed impossible just yesterday
Can 2020 take even more from us?
2020 has taken too much.

Mythbusters and White Rabbit Project were legendary shows.

The world will never be the same after this.
Ok,I‚Äôm officially saying it now, 2020 fuckin blows

I always forget that this is what most redditors look like. If they aren‚Äôt in highschool like that, they‚Äôre some CS or Engineering major sitting on their gaming laptop in a dining hall by themselves. 
I‚Äôll be honest though, it‚Äôs this kind of shit that ruins people‚Äôs lives. It‚Äôs a good thing that most of us are like the kid in the second panel. Because I that it was bad, and I was fucking pathetic and I had to ‚Äúget a life‚Äù. I snuck out just to see what it was like, I almost never slept but slept through my classes. I watched fights in the bathroom at school during lunch, betting on who‚Äôd win, I abused drugs in grade 9. Before grade ten I already started smoking and drinking, me and 14 of my buddies would all stay in one house , drink ourselves to sleep on the roof deck, wake up, have a smoke then drink some more. 

I wasted my high school life doing shit I promised to never do. I wasted the rest of my life from then until this point hating myself and asking why I would ever do the stupid shit I‚Äôd pull off.

Dont fucking disrespect peep
Lil peep actually had struggles and hardships during his life. It‚Äôs funny that his legacy now holds up to 13 year olds watching simpsonwave videos and crying about a girl who turned them down in 4th grade. 
Too bad half the sub is over 20 at this point...

I don't get the double styrofoam cup thing for keeping their drinks cold, just buy a Yeti-type cup.  It saves the environment and has better insulation to keep their syrup cold for hours.  Teens these days.

&gt;I‚Äôm in this photo and I don‚Äôt like it
69k likes, nice
The thing is, if you look like the bottom photo, in order to get to the point of the top photo, you really have to make a lot of decisions that go against your better judgement, upbringing, culture, peer pressure, environment, education, etc. (And I do apologize for judging books by their covers but the photos and title are all I have to work with.)

It is a lot easier to casually *feel* it, rather than actually *become* it. A great example of this is weight loss. So many feel the inspiration, so few actually overcome all of the above influences and actually change their lifestyle. Although, in the case of the contrasting photos, it is objectively better NOT to overcome those things. 

If I may take the liberty, I will say that drugs "help" people forget themselves and the top photo probably is the result of "drugs". Not a great look. Don't do drugs until you're a responsible person who has all their shit together, and never do meth or heroin. 
Ah not an issue for me I see 0 everywhere on my answer sheet once I get it back

Just got to university and started studying mathematics.Now I feel like high school math isn‚Äôt anything compared to this

Nah. It's when the Greek letters come in that you start to panic.
It gets worse. 

I'm at the point where we're using shapes. I multiplied a square by a triangle to get a kevin.

Guys while making additions with double digits numbers I sometimes make mistakes like 2+6=18

Why I'm such a dumb dumb when it comes to maths
*cries in statistics*
The X‚Äôs are okay, but dont get me started on dividing without a calculator. It‚Äôs horrible and I will never get any better. I‚Äôm 21 years old, in college, got my ‚Äúcalculating‚Äù exam coming up next month and I still take 3 years per question... Just fucking give me my calculator man

One of my best friends is an engineering student and I'll take a look at his homework when I'm over occasionally. It's so fucking wild when you see a gigantic equation of nothing but symbols. It's so far over my head when he talks about it I feel like a caveman.
What's 8+5
Why‚Äôd ya have to put letters and numbers together? Why can‚Äôtcha just go fuck yerself?
6 years: X is just a letter!
8 years: X means multiply
12 years: X is..... just a letter again?
lol, i was just watching the episiode that they said ''well well, how the turntables'' in The Office and saw this.
Y=b solve for a
So many ppl are commenting on gow its "how the tables have turned." Its a meme from the office. I would call you subcultures swine, but you're not even that. You're the -5 IQ fleas with autism that try to attach themselves to the rock in the pig pen belonging to the uncultured swine. You're the bottom feeders. The creatures so low on the food chain that nobody even fucking eats you. You are the bacteria that grows underneath the rocks in the Mariana Trench. I would say you needed a microscope to see your brain if you even had one. Next time your gonna correct someone, make sure they're actually fucking wrong you retarded yelp-critic-wannabe dickwads.
I'm 14 and rarely see numbers in math

Edit: I'm currently in Algebra 1CD

Yo, if a girl texted me that I would talk about how I want to get a Vikings burial
I fucking love vikings. Unironically, this would give me an instant boner and cause me to ignore any other flaws she may have.

I have this book, I‚Äôll ACTUALLY do this to my crush if ppl want me to lol, and I‚Äôll post it.

Hey everybody! It‚Äôs Leif Erikson Day!
If a girl texted me that, I would ask her out immediately
I am very interested in the history of the Vikings, Scandinavian tribes, and the germanic peoples, so if anyone did, I'd think they're a catch. I'll think I'll use that.

If a girl ever starts a convo with me like that it'll be love at first sight
I mean it definitely gets your attention
Honestly I‚Äôd end up rambling bout Norse mystic mythology, but then Thor then marvel, then how much I love marvel, then back to Vikings
Mention cars, computers, games, food, or TV

You‚Äôre liable to hit an interest somewhere amongst those five categories.
It clearly says you're supposed to say this in a face-to-face conversation, you're failure is due to your own incompetence. Return to the temple and expect further education
Damn, I think I threw that book away. Who knew it would be so useful?
r/HistoryMemes would approve of this.

Edit: the bot messaged me, its a repost alright
Nothing gets me more interested in a girl than that one time Lee Farikson discovered North America
I am Norwegian and Scottish so I could technically get a Viking burial because of culture but it would be expensive
My grandma got me this book. I'm a lesbian.
Unironically, I'd have an hours long conversation with a girl if she texted me this sentence. Furthermore I'd immediately ask her out.

Idk what the author of this book did, but he is damn surely right
I HAVE THIS BOOK AT HOME! My favorite page is the one titled ‚Äúhow to get a boy‚Äôs attention‚Äù and there‚Äôs stuff like put a photo of yourself in his sandwich, go skydiving, and dress like a rockstar. The entire girls guide series is whack.
I kinda want to know what the Jell-o one is about

This is old af. Which one of ya pulled this back up for like 3 years ago?
7%???? Lmaoo yea more like "Watch college teens fucking DIE from stress"
What are you doing ***Step College***?
Don't worry it gets better! You can eventually refinance for only 6.9%!
*laughs in not going to college*
Ey first day of college for me tmoz (well technically today) and it's 20 to 3 and I have to be up at 7 gg
what are you doing step loan
Plot twist: it's actually the start of a porno and she fucks him to get lower interest
7 fucking %???? Americans are hard to be
If you are a kid in the middle or lower class but want to go to an expensive college because it will look good on your job applications in the increasingly competitive field of work you chose, and if you don‚Äôt go you will feel like a failure for the rest of your life, clap your hands!
üëèüëè
University is like 22K USD where I'm from and it's still only 1% interest. Americans have it hard man.
These are making me scared to go to college.
"oh no, I forgot my purse, is there any other way I can... pay the interest?
:,)
step college you pissed on the toilet seat
Wanna hear my collage fees ? If I convert it in dollars

$ 44
Rule 69: Someone‚Äôs into that
If possible, try a community college. You'll save so much money not spending it on meal plans and housing. Books can be pretty bullshit pricey, especially if you're going into law or economics.
[deleted]
In Australia we have HECS, where we don't need to start paying until we earn over a certain amount, and there's no time limit on the loan. It's either low or no interest, can't remember. You can stay in university you're whole life, earn under a certain amount and never have to pay the debt.
So its not like it's impossible to have a have better system in America.
background noises: ***fap fap fAP FAP FAP***
Is this how rich people get off?
Now that‚Äôs the porn we need!misleading titles that shows you something that is technically true to the title.
Artist made a mistake. Should say 70.8%
If you're looking to go on strike for your student debt in USA, look into "Debt Collective." It's a .org website in dedicating toward abolishing student debt. You're not a loan. 

Did you know if Congress abolished the almost 2.7 trillion debt, the government would get back 5 billion within 5-8 years from GDP. Extra money means more funds towards goods and services.

They're also the artists, students, and professors that helped get Occupy Wallstreet going.

Xo
Me: Janitor life, here I come !
I was able to return my loan before I got fucked
I don‚Äôt relate yet lol but I‚Äôm sure next semester will
Hahaha.
This hurts and I‚Äôm feeling attacked.
Meanwhile in Finland you both get government paid student allowance from age 16 forward, plus housing allowance *and* most places have student apartment renting companies that rent shared flats for cheap prices with utilities (including internet, think it was 100mbs in my last student apartment) included in rent.

If that isn't enough you can also take government-backed loan with 0% interest during your studies *and* if you graduate in time with decent grades you get part of the loan forgiven. Think it had ~1% interest for me after graduating.
lol :,) haha :,) just my 5% apr that is just going to go up once my dad stops cosigning it :,) hhaa:,)
Is this something I'm too European to get
BRO MY INTEREST IS 12%!!!! FUCK I MADE A MISTAKE
Is this some kind of American joke I'm too European to understand?

I know it's the joke to make fun of college/university, but in the long run, it is worth it.

Nowadays, even a Bachelor's degree is a dime a dozen. The higher you go, the more freedom, opportunity, and choices you have in life to live how you want. Not to mention, improvements in your social circle quality, and giving a better platform for your own children to do well in life too.
Instead of "forgiving" student loan debt they should just make them interest free.  That would also make tuition cheaper.  Most likely only be federal loans and they have a cap on how much you can borrow in a year.  No more Sally mae
Can someone explain me USA loans
7% wait till you get a credit card
mine is 10% :,)
Literally gimping yourself at life for no discernable reason is the American dream
Eye holes are nostrils and eye brows are the eyes.

Good ol C&amp;H comics


...I'm glad I didn't go to college and whenever my friends make a joke at my expense I just respond with "man its great being debt free" which usually pisses them off lol.
ìÄê&lt;- college (not a cock)
Ah, I love having to not pay for universities here.
I was seeing an ad from a bank about loans and the interest rate was like 25%
7.08%??!!??!??
Anddd..thus is why I'm still working shit jobs as a 32 yr old. Can't afford thise type of loans.
Lol ü§£
7%? That's it? In India the average interest for student loan is 10.5% and sadly I have one on my hard rn.
How can 7% be allowed? Normal interest rate now is like 1,5%
*laughs in 300 per semester and only paying half the loan back*
*laughs in free college*
Laughts in europian
In my country there are state-run universities that are free for all and charging so much interest on a loan would be a crime. America sure is pretty fucked up considering it's literally one of the richest countries in the world
*Laughs in Danish*
7%? I got a better rate on my car
good thing the career path I‚Äôve chosen will make me end up with zero loan debt. Fuck that shit lol.
Wtf is interest really 7 in America? I live in Turkey and my interest is 0.9 and it starts after 2 years of my graduation.
*laughs in European*
Welcome to the netherlands where student loans have 0% interest and you get free public transport as a student.
I'm a year away from College, is it REALLY that bad in America?
The bitch thought he meant annually, but no! She got played! Always read the small print at the bottom! 7% compound monthly interest
\*Laughs in German  


University fees (at Christian-Albrechts-Universit√§t in Kiel) are around 550‚Ç¨ a year, but you also get free public transport in Schleswig-Holstein and Hamburg
Back when I started in 2011 I was at 6.3%.

Imagine being productive and getting something accomplished. This comment was made by me I made it
Saw this on r/art and thought it was neat, but i neVER KNEW IT WAS MASSIVE AND THAT MAKES IT MORE IMPRESSIVE!
The cookies are amazing.

The painting is cool too I guess-
Gifted people: Already painting Van Gogh by the time they're in their teens.

Me: Can't decide whether to get out bed in the morning.
this is incredible
I guess it is legit post so here is my updoot and poor man‚Äôs gold üèÖ
Prepare for the creepy messages
if this dies in new i will shoot myself, very well made
This is just crazy.. I love it. I will tell you something about Van gogh's painting that you maybe don't know op. The sky is this painting EXISTED. It is the sky  that Van Gogh saw from his room in the asylum. An astrophysist, Jean Pierre Luminet made a documentary on it. But here is the interesting thing : Luminer studied it and use a device and found the exact day when the sky was like this : 1889, may the 25th, 4:40am. The brightest star is Venus. (Here hidden by waves). And Luminet also found out there was a galaxy at this place or something. Crazy right ? And some paintings of Van Gogh are linked and complete the others.

Your paiting is just crazy.. The colors and the styles bend very well and your technic.. DAMN. I give you my respects.
answering some questions that a lot of people have been asking:
- honestly don‚Äôt know how long this took (a really long time is my best estimate); painting process was as follows. as a rising ninth grader i looked up starry night and the great wave and was like damn wouldn‚Äôt that be cool on my bedroom wall, so i painted my wall blue, dicked around for a few months, sketched it in chalk, dicked around for a few more months, then painted the majority of it last august and this spring. i‚Äôm a rising junior now btw

- i used cheap liquitex acrylic paint and a clearance bulk pack of brushes from michaels

- i‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 i used a ladder

- this is my most recent and best painting hence why i posted it, i‚Äôm not proud of my other shit lol. i also don‚Äôt have many pieces in general this is like my fourth acrylic piece lol 

- i posted this on r/art so i could get enough karma to post on here, genuinely didn‚Äôt expect both to blow up. thank you so much for the kind words and awards

- i‚Äôm 15 i don‚Äôt have a website and i‚Äôve never done prints. i‚Äôm honestly speechless at the fact people wanna pay money for this ;-; that‚Äôs so cool guys. just google starry night and great wave and you‚Äôll find thousands just like the painting

- yes you can have a cookie üç™
Damn thats pretty good
VAN GOGH LOOK OUT IT'S A FUCKING TSUNAMI OH GOD OH FUCK HE CANT HEAR ME HIS EAR IS GONE OH GOD OH FUCK
Imagine doing something productive, if rather be a prt of the apathetic failure piece of shit gang üòé
Seriously though thats amazing, great job!
Finally, an actually interesting post in r/teenager! Those are rare

I see you got some inspiration from Vincent van Gogh
I can‚Äôt even draw a proper square fucking hell

you're a fucking waterbender lol
Yo that‚Äôs super great! Love it! 10000 times better than anything I would have done. It looks awesome, yo.
This is the best piece of art that I've seen today


Pssttt! Are the cookies complementary?
And I thought my copy of Starry Night in Junior High was impressive. Absolutely stunning and inspiring
Wow very nice. All I‚Äôve been doing with my extra time is going to my backyard and trying to relearn how to do a rainbow flick
Wow, congrats!
That is  i n s a n e I'm actually speechless
This person needs a award irl
Hands down one of the most beautiful paintings I've ever seen
WOW I'm shocked this is beautiful. I'm out of words, speechless. You have talent and mind I said if it were up for sale I would love to have this beautiful work of art.
A mix of starry night and the great wave, excellent choice and congrats
Damn I haven‚Äôt baked in ages, I should really get back into that.
You a fuckin legend
Wow this is amazing. Both pieces really do compliment each other.

Wish I could draw like this. Amazing job!
Baking cookies almost seems less celebratory than finishing the painting and showing it off
:)

The great wave of kanagawa and starry night
I love your shirt!
That‚Äôs incredible, great job!
Those two paintings are my favourites!!
Damn thats Van Gogh's Starry Night
This is great op! I use the punctuation to make sure you know I am happy and that you feel good.
I literally just did this with my job application-
My feelings just got invaded
aaaaaaaaahhh she knows
h‚Äîhow do you know?
I do this shit so often! But sometimes I mix it up.

Like throwing in more than one exclamation!!
I hate emailing for this very reason. I don‚Äôt know proper email etiquette and feel odd whenever I include an exclamation point
I work as a receptionist and I always keep this in mind when emailing someone lol
It's incredible how many random things we all share in common without having the slightest clue.  We are all connected folks, case closed.
damn
What‚Äôs a period in this context?
I feel attacked!
thatisitfromthispointonwardsnomorepuncuationsiproposeamotiontobanallformsofpunctuationsspacesandcapitalizations
I wish someone had taught me how to do this. All of my emails are either angry or extremely dry.
Are these things people actually think about? Am I weird?
Oh. Okay!
This my life! Sorry. But it's true. Preach!
What‚Äôs the point of the exclamation mark if you coulD JUST DO THIS
And you know something going on with me when i use multiple dots...
Pretty much the go-to ways to email people that you don't know so much about, but good enough for you to be a bit informal.
The word is normality. It exists (sorry for sounding like a troll, but I hate it when neologisms are invented when there is a really great word available).
In PMs I write xD after every message so that people feel uncomfortable when I suddenly stop
I hate all of you. Why the f√ºck does someone write down my exact thoughts?
Damn dude! Thats to accurate. Stop pointing me out like that.
I'm 37 and I have never grown out of this. Beware ye!
That's so accurate! I do this all the time. It's funny how people do that, I guess we are kind of similar. Very funny though!
i can only see a mirror help
As an old man, I'm a little saddened by all the people yelling at me. 

In journalism they used to say "you get one exclamation mark your entire career."

Times change. 

But I think it shows the weakness of the English language. People are communicating so much more via print now than they did in the past. To show the subtle inflections of raising the voice, we don't have enough symbols.

And before I get any hate, I'm a fan of English. Don't @ me.
&gt;‚ÄúOne should never use exclamation points in writing. It is like laughing at your own joke.‚Äù 

(Mark Twain)
Hey! This is personal!
Oh my god this is literally how I wrote the announcement for questions for the podcast. I really dint expect this today.
When you want inflection to mean more than it does, but it just comes off as crazy...
That‚Äôs one accurate tweet! I‚Äôm sure most of us can relate to this. Some of us even comment like this, it weirdly makes us sound like computers.
Thank‚Äôs for this post OP!
I thought I was the only one who thinks like that. Oh well
I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I‚Äôve used an exclamation point for anything.  Seriously, I can‚Äôt think of a time where I have, at least unironically.
Hey thats me!

Conveying the important bit. 

Have a great day!
Lol mood *dabs*
I can relate to this
I don't get it!!!!!
There was a BBC article on a study that showed that women tend to overuse exclamation points as a way to portray friendliness. It's interesting.
https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190606-the-danger-of-overusing-exclamation-marks#:~:text=In%20a%202006%20study%2C%20researchers,friendliness%20in%20their%20professional%20interactions.
If you can't tell people in person how you feel... Punctuation has got your back! (this is to let you know I'm excited and friendly)
What‚Äôs a period?
Im in this picture and i dont like it
If you're interrested in these types of language interactions, I recommend reading: Because Internet. Great book about language usage online.
Woah! you didn't use an exclamation point, why do you hate me so much op.
This is the reason I only read the middle sentence of every paragraph that someone sends me
My colleague once installed one of these grammar improvement programs on his work emails.

He started getting really arsey calls from clients, and the director stopped being friendly with him.

Turns out it was bolding and caps locking random words AFTER he sent the email - so he had no clue until he looked into it!

One example was to the director, who asked my colleague to amend a drawing he'd done. Politely he replied "Sorry James, please find the amended drawing attached. Any problems let me know." Sort of thing.

Looked into it... SORRY *JAMES*. Please find the amended drawing **ATTACHED**. ANY PROBLEMS LET ME KNOW.

I laughed so hard at him all day!
I like to throw a semicolon in; it makes me seem more intelligent.
Imagine giving gold because someone posted someone else‚Äôs tweet
Yoooo, I‚Äôm from uk and never realised period meant full stop.
What I can't stand ... Is the liberal use of ... Ellipsis instead of actual punctuation ... To create unending sentences... Which usually ramble over useless... Shit.
I checked my texts with my new swim coach and yeah... they‚Äôre all like this on my end.
What about the E-Mail subject? It's the most mysterious thing humankind ever created.
This is more true than it needs to be
i can relate a lot to this my pet peeve is when people dont use capitals and dont use ponctuation so there sentence is way too long and also when people don‚Äôt know the correct use of their their and there to use like some times people are dumb
Always gotta remain wary of premature exclamation
We've been exposed!  It is over.
Hey! I hate excitement! Fuck off! Really! Suck my Dick and swallow my balls! I should not have said that on the underage subreddit! Especially because im 20! I also have a girlfriend! Whos of legal age!
Never before have I been so offended by something I 100% agree with.
Lol
and now you know I‚Äôm mad at you.
No... don‚Äôt call me out like this
Am 30. Done this every time for the past 12 years.
Hope this email finds you well
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/8S0FDjFBj8o)
I‚Äôm in this tweet and I don‚Äôt like it
oh my god I don't even worry about my writing that much but I still think about this
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt like it
I'm feeling feelings that don't exist because of this
Im calling the grammar police
It's a nice format for e-mails though. I like receiving such.
It‚Äôs nice to not be alone. =)
I guess I‚Äôm different. I use only commas periods and question marks. I don‚Äôt see the point in adding emotion if I can convey my point in a more civil manner
I write emails all day long like this at work. I'm in my thirties.

Is this bad?
How dare you mock me
Ummmm excuse me this is an invasion of privacy.
Frankly, I'm disappointed the comma wasn't mentioned.
I hate exclamation marks in casual chat/emailing.

They always seem fake to me.
As a non-teenager seeing this on /r/all, it seems like a lot of you worry this is a bad thing, but honestly in my opinion this is just good writing style. The exclamation sentences allow you to emphasise some things and stop the whole email from being dry. 

If you're emailing someone for the first time or a superior definitely go easy on them or don't use any. But in general this is a good way to be with relatively informal emails with colleagues.
there's no in between for a . and a !

not in formal settings anyways
It fucking got me when i found out the comic "Donald Duck" ends eevry sentence with a "!" (Or.... / ?"
Me, reading someone's business email where they use two exclamation points in the same sentence: " This person is clearly deranged."
I've always felt it was weird to end a sentence with "!" every time.
I-
I just did this talking to someone who cancelled a purchase from me. Like I actually consciously think about it.
You can catch on to more an more of these social games the more you listen to people. They're by far and away most of what people are saying and doing in my experience. Truly spontaneous and genuine people are unicorns.
I just like to keep it professional all the way
Comma as a buffer.

I've been exposed. How could you?
When Pathfinder writes an email
How the hell do teenagers know this? This is an advanced adult professional procedure. Who taught you this?

This is highly unusual!
Good morning, mr. [insert name],

I have a problem with/I want to ask you something comcerning [insert issue/question].

Best regards,

My school has this program where you get credit and stuff if you "volunteer" to introduce prospective students and tell them about your experiences and what not. (Yes, I go to a prep school.) but it's so weird sending a random kid your age an email abt "how great my school is" and I know one hundred percent I do not follow this one exclamation point per 3 sentence rule. I'm just trying to break this internet tension alright!
I! Dont? Know. How? To! Be. ¬øSocial
Yep, I never put two sentences with exclamations in a row. I usually only use it with the ‚Äúthanks!‚Äù. It feels weird to write it without the exclamation point.
Lots of text
What the fuck is a period as in this circumstance
Meanwhile my vocabulary consists of . and a , even at uni levels.
They don't think It be like it is, but it do!
Me!...
Once our teachers heard a bunch of people swearing so after assembly the headmistress made all the BOYS stay back and write all the swear words we know on a piece of paper and burn it. Even though the girls were also swearing. I got shoulder cramps cuz of that
They closed down all the 8th grade boys bathrooms in my middle school because vaping so I had to go into the girls since that was less of a punishment than going into the lower grade's bathrooms
We can‚Äôt even go to the bathroom in ours because graffiti... which happened ONE time and ONE person. They principal even called it an ‚Äúempty threat‚Äù but he still lets it get to him
My gym teacher told us he hated teen boys, and apparently in his health class he would let the girls be on their phone and leave class early but if a boy wasn't perfectly silent he would flip out. That guy was crazy though, he got super mad at things that the next day would have him laughing. He once made us line up in alphabetical order from M-Z and then A-L behind them, and got pissed when it took us longer.
*Something happens*

Teacher - All the boys come out of their seats now!
Me: at all guys school
In my school, if a boy is caught doing even the smallest thing, he will be pulled out into the hallway, lectured for about 15 minutes with a lot of yelling and the boy won‚Äôt be allowed to have a say in the matter.
One time when I was younger two people (girls) were beating up one person (boy) and so I (boy) stepped in and told the girls to stop hitting him and when they didn‚Äôt listen I pushed them away from him, later I go to the office and I‚Äôm getting yelled at for not using my words when the two girls got off Scott free
In 5th grade during our reward party someone threw toilet paper everywhere and all the boys in the pod had to clean it up and couldn‚Äôt go back to the reward party. Similar thing happened to the girls and they had the janitors clean it up and no one got in trouble.
Bruh at my school. One day we had soccer and if the guys side lost they'd have a punishment of 50 pushups, but if the girls lost they had no punishment, but if they won they'd get out of this thing we do called work out Wednesday (workout Wednesday sucks) but the guys had no prize if they win except not having pushups. Man, totally fair. üòÅ
Welcome to my highschool where the freshmen boys destroy the bathrooms while singing all star
Reminds me of the time my high school found a bunch of cheerleaders doing lines of coke in the locker room.  Nothing happened.

Well, a week later, the coke dealer - a dude - was arrested.  Nothing happened to the cheerleaders, though.
One time in grade 7 (I think) our school was vaccinating the students at our school. 

I was in my French class, and the teacher kept telling the class to be quiet. Most of the boys went down to get their vaccines, some of us were vaccinated already. The class was still really loud though.

Then the boys come back, and it's still loud. All The girls go down for their vaccines (idk why it was *all* of them) and for the next few minutes, it was the quietest class I've ever been in. Everyone was silently doing their work.

When the girls got back, it was loud again.

Next day class was loud and teacher said if we don't quiet down the boys are staying behind for a few minutes.

I was very cheesed after that
Every fucking time literally anything happened in my school they‚Äôd always pin it on I guy.  I think I need to make this crystal fucking clear to you all:  not once in my four years at high school did I ever see a girl get suspended, or given detention, or even fucking scolded by a teacher.  It fucking pisses me off to no end, and to top it off they wouldn‚Äôt even let girls go to the school.
During evacuation drills in my old school the teachers basically told us boys our lives were worthless, During the evacuation drills they told all the boys they had to surround the girls to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù them.  After that I got pissed and just walked off cause I knew this was bullshit
Yup, got suspended in 2nd grade because a group of girls were bullying me on the playground. They kept grabbing me and pushing me around while insulting me so I jerked my arms to get free and ended up hitting one of them. They went crying to a teacher and I got in trouble. Funny how things work
Actually, this even happens amongst boys. I was just chilling in the classroom with the quiet kid and the intelligent kid. These two dumbfucks came rushing in, throwing water at each other and all over the room. Our dumbass sports teacher came in just 5 seconds after everyone was in teh class. He asked everyone as to who made the two boys wet, no one replied because no one did it. Do you know what was his solution?


200m rounds of our whole basketball courtyard 50 times followed by jumping jacks until the next class ends.

I passed out on what I think was the 34th round and when I woke up at home, I saw my mother, like I never saw her before. She was REALLY mad. You could see the red glint in her eyes. The teacher really fucked up because 3 more kids passed out. He was kicked from the school.


The quiet kid brought cake in the celebration because he, too passed out
when someone hurts me: fights back
schools and teachers: in  school suspension for you and let the other kid off without a warning.
fuck you peice of shit posh school in peru. coleghio roosevelt. kids picked on me then i got in trouble for not telling teachers even tho i have done it before and it doesnt do shit bout it
My school practices pure equality; if 2 kids get in a fight, they both get the same punishment no matter who started the fight or threw the first punch.
We had a health class where they brought in a guest speaker to talk about consent and she said "girls, make sure that if you don't want sex you strongly say no. Boys, if she says no stop"

Nothing about both sexes being able to say No or listening to the other gender. Nope. Guys just gotta learn to listen
At my school it was less ‚Äúboys‚Äù and more ‚Äú8th graders‚Äù (this was last year at my middle school) 

a 7th grader punched an 8th grader who did nothing wrong? 8th graders fault
There was this one girl at my school that kept in hitting a guy and one time he pushed her away and he got suspended, my school is broken
Factual statement
My school has this thing where if boys commit a really bad offence (Like fighting), they get caned. But meanwhile, girls who do literally the same thing just get regular detention??

I‚Äôm a girl and even I think this is stupid
in india every male teacher is sexist af. just scold boys and flirt with girls
Girls ***giggle*** you can leave after the bell,but BOYS, YOU HAVE TO STAY FOR DETENTION
I had this substitute once and she immediately told us she hated the sound of teen boys laughing, safe to say she was a bitch
lol. the boys at my school are literally so normal. maybe 1-2 boy fights a year. it's the girls that are crazy. there's at least 1 girl fight a week. and I'm not talking just slapping each other. I've seen broken jaws, broken noses, etc. they don't fucking play.
This was way too true with my middle school
My religion teacher would always blame and only punish boys for anything, while girls were supposed to be little perfect angels and never do anything bad
Same someone took a dump on the sidewalk and the boys bathroom was closed for the rest of the semester. The worst thing about that was it was a girl who took the dump.
Lmao, my school has a department of diversity where they take care that there's diversity in the school. Ten years ago they forced a musulman child to pray to jesus crist, how time change things
Dude my middle school was so sexist to boys I did make a post on r/teenagers about it and it should be on my profile if you wanna read the story
When I did my student teaching they had to tell all the girls that if they did not stop shoving bloody tampons/paper towels in the paper towel dispensers they would take all the dispensers out of the girls' bathrooms.     

Girls can be as fucked up as anybody.
Actually depends on the schools, i did high school in two different places (just started college) in the public school we barely did shit, when it happened it would be a specific group within the class. 
In opposite to the private one, girls, the devilish beings were the source of trouble the were 18/28 students of the class, whenever there was drama the boys would look at each other and laugh cuz hell was about to raise.
reading these comments, what kind of schools do you go to what the actual fuck
In my school no matter what happened it would be blamed on boys. 


Oh yeah we're a boy only school. 
It's very sad.
Got a teacher who picks up boys on the tiniest thing. If we‚Äôre not looking at her or not sitting up straight enough or literally fucking breathing, bang, she‚Äôll single us out for it. She literally told my mate to wait outside because he yawned in class. Meanwhile there‚Äôs girls all over the room talking and not paying attention and she doesn‚Äôt bat a fucking eyelid. I‚Äôm this close to losing my shit at her (and probably failing the class while I‚Äôm at it)
After reading all the stories, it's pretty obvious us guys can't go through life without going through unjust punishment.

Please, if anyone sees this, stay strong. We were all meant to suffer for the mere crime of being born, that is the hypocrisy in equality, and I doubt it will go away soon, so stay strong. Be brave in the face of hardship, because punishment could be many more ways to improve so long as you make something good out of it.
In my school one teacher doesnt let the boys in the classroom during breaktime (breaktime is a period of time before class starts it lasts around 15min)
She only lets in the girls "beacuse they are shouting etc" while in reality theyre the ones that be shouting all the time and for that the boys cant come in to the classroom
[deleted]
They also have all these girl only clubs and they don‚Äôt have any boy only clubs.
I'm a girl and sometimes I feel bad for the boys, because they always get punishment.
In my class teachers blame adhd because everyone is either on ritalin or needs to be


They say we're the shittiest STEM class they've ever seen


"Would you rather sit on a cock and eat a cake or sit on a cake and eat a cock? I'd rather sit on a cock and it a cock" ~the boy next to me, very loudly, in the middle of science class(yeah the teacher heard, no she didn't anything, yeah they're all used to this shit)
Sexism at a young age, thanks school!
Also in my class girls like to think they're immune to punishments so they would snitch all the time for boys but not for other girls. Like the teacher made every boy in my class sign a treaty, even the boys that didnt did it have to sign it too.
L.I.T.T.E.R.A.L.L.Y
one of my teachers got starbucks for the girls, saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúweird‚Äù for guys to get starbucks. like, what?
Dress codes

The boys are ***always*** looking at girls butts.

So that means they're ***all*** going to become rapists.

Lets blame boys for our inability to allow girls to wear clothes that are deemed as "revealing"
Something similar happened to me. I was walking home from school and saw a couple kids, who were white, start play fighting or something. I watch the fight, doing ABSOLUTELY nothing. A teacher comes over with the rage of a thousand lions and accuses me of fighting, I'm Mexican btw. My brother, who looks less tan than me and is in football. Told the teacher I did nothing. She believed him, but not me. Next day, the principal follows me down the path to the sidewalk till my mom intervenes and calls him out.
Another nail in the coffin for my gender
I studied in an all boys school and it was surprisingly calm and cultured for having no filter at all. I guess it was because there was no one to impress..
[deleted]
My school is extremely sexist and is like this and favors girls. Im a girl so youd think that im good. NO ITS A NIGHTMARE. I hate the fact that boys arent expected to have straight As and girls are. IM NOT SOME NERD AND IM FINE WITH Bs AND Cs.
This happened to me yesterday in school. Man it feels so gahhhhhhhh
There was a fire this morning in my school. They said it was the boys locker room hallway.
I was at a summer camp and I was in the bunk room with a bunch of "hooligans". So one day during our freetime they took the only colored skin kids bed. They proceeded to throw it in the nasty ass showers, and make jokes that he could sleep anywhere because he was "from africa and should be used to it". Well they got caught, and everyone in the bunk room including the ones that weren't even in the room or participating got to clean up the long and filthy cafetiria.
But can it blow up blue balloons
I have no words to describe how fucking cool you are other than "I have no words to describe how fucking cool you are"

[Bustin makes me feel good ](https://youtu.be/0tdyU_gW6WE)
Why is this titled ‚Äúdon‚Äôt drink and drive‚Äù? This message is about distracted driving - using your phone while driving.

Ironic that the sign is also distracting.
Dang, that looks beautiful. Theres nothing like a city skyline in the morning
How did you manage to fuck up the title?
i feel like these things have definently caused an accident before
Ok but why is this on the front page of r/teenagers?
Understood. I'll text them instead.
old, bad and reposted a milion times

This is in Delaware! DelDOT does a ton of signs like this, they‚Äôve had some hilarious ones lol
I bet I could drink beer with that guy
Don't worry I only drink and then drive I do t drink and drive

**BREAKING NEWS**

*DUI RATE DROPS TO ZERO PERCENT*
I once saw one that said, "Drive hammered, get nailed."
Half the time cars are just gonna woosh by and see "No one you're driving" without the question preceding it and so this is bad.

The sign: let me hold you right there
I saw that on the r/ memes last month
I do t get this.  I talk on the phone all day when I'm in my truck.
Do you know Joe?
We can't even drive johnatan!
ME: drives drunk and sees i need to call someone to remind them not to drive' drink and call at the same time
No, im calling yuri
How about the passengers...?
GHOST BUSTE- no?
Don't drive and drive
Don't drink car before driving alcohol
So if I'm reading the title correctly I can't drive while drunk but it's fine if I'm on lsd, meth and coke while flying a plane
Is this Ohio? We got some pretty funny ones
Dang are u drinking it says don't call and u even read it wrong
Very cool. Why do t we get this in the eu countries. We all this broke, that cant afford a led sign 400x200cm, so we can have these amusing messages or what the funk?!

Okay but can we call people we're not driving?

Was this from r/funny or r/memes
Why did I rear end that guy, officer? I was reading a billboard instead of KEEPING MY EYES ON THEROAD.
The title says don't drink and drive but this image is about using your phone and driving...
But you are taking pix of these sick signs just like they intended
Did they drive past the same sign twice to get this shot or
It's usually adults I see doing this, ages 40-50s.
*laughs in car comes with non-holdable phone*
Remember: if you make a call while driving it should be to the ghost busters so someone can direct your ghost.
GHOST BUS---Oh.
Shows a meme about texting and driving "don't drink and drive"
Shows how little people understand technology.

Yes, you do want to call while you're driving ... I can voice-command call anyone with my phone without ever looking at it.

What causes accidents is **TEXTING** and looking down to correct a word or finish a sentence.
Imagine someone is speeding, so they don‚Äôt see the second message of the sign, and remember they have to take a call, ‚ÄúWho you gonna call?‚Äù ‚ÄúSOMEONE!!‚Äù
there's a sign that changes daily on Holmes Beach here that says things like "get your head out of your apps" and "cats have 9 lives... you don't"
In Indiana if you're over 21 with a valid license you can use a "telecommunications device" while driving

isn't that message about being on your phone while driving tho
Awkward lack of punctuation.  I read it as:

"Who you gonna call?"

"No one you're driving"

I mean, yeah, they are in the car with you, why would you call them?
Don‚Äôt cross the high beams
What does this have to do with r/teenagers
It would be so misfortune if someone were to crash in that hoarding
It should be, 'No one, you're driving" instead of "no one you're you driving. Cause now it sounds like you can't call your passengers
Cant call while driving, cant text while driving, CAN write a 5 paragraph letter with a feather pen on parchment while driving

I usually wear my hair in a side part... I wonder how they'd react to me dying one side white...
A long time ago at work a grandmother came in with like a neon blue hair I was like daym mam I love your hair!! The old lady got super bashful and started bragging ‚Äúmy granddaughter did it for me she has pink hair‚Äù 
I love old people like this . She was so cute!
Bruh my sister has bright pink hair and a Karen haircut... it makes me want to gouge my eyeballs out and eat them
Or a woman wearing a hijab
I have purple hair so i get this a lot
I now want left for dead 3 to open with this cutscene.
(Sort of) old person lurker here. My kids are almost teens and this sub is oh so helpful for helping me not accidentally be completely under a rock (well, sometimes) this one had me rolling enough I had to put myself! 

I‚Äôm taking my youngest who is actually under the age of ten to get her hair done this week. She wants a half shave but still hasn‚Äôt picked her color. Usually I do the girls hair However they want, but a half shave is above my pay grade. The last time I colored their hair, (when it wasn‚Äôt temporary) we all did purple. Myself included. Someday I hope to be that one grandma who shows up to church with rainbow hair, maybe a Mohawk? It will be a good addition to my snake ‚Äúnecklace‚Äù named cuddles

Ah Coach from Left 4 Dead 2
this is why you dye your hair green instead
Shame really, because (straight male here) partially colored hair is hot as all hell. The problem is, the people who end up coloring their hair are many times the people you _don't_ want to be in a relationship with. (i.e. the blue-haired feminist meme)
Young jospef is still a boomer lol

When old people stare at my piercings i stare tf back
its a natural deterrent for people like you
Wasn‚Äôt this meme being being reposted over and over again in different formats a few months ago? I guess that‚Äôs kind of where Reddit is right now

In all honesty though, blue hair does look pretty weird. And why are you dying your hair if you don‚Äôt want people to look?
This old man is clearly blind neither of those two bois had any blue hair
Hell yeah, I‚Äôve been 2 months cut-free, let‚Äôs keep it up together
that‚Äôs awesome!! make it a million months??!!!!
yessir. i can barelllyyyy see the scars. keep it up!
Good job I'm so proud of you. you should feel so good everyone here loves you so much‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Keep up the good work :)  beautiful human
Really I can‚Äôt express how proud I am, even though we don‚Äôt know each other it‚Äôs amazing to see a person overcome such things
Nice! You can keep it up, I seriously believe in you. Quitting stuff like this is hard, but once you get off it for the first time it is easier to keep away from it. When I quit it, I used to go for a run until my legs gave up when I felt like I needed to feel myself, it worked. But you got to find your own way, I'm sure you can do it :)
Hell yeah drinks are on me
And by drinks I mean straight lemonade &gt;:)
I don't know if this helps but I barely see the battle scars. Keep it going the right way dude!
Congrats! I‚Äôm only one week cut free.
Bro that's big dick energy well done
That‚Äôs great, and hopefully you never start again
Let‚Äôs fucking go mate, I‚Äôm 2 months and counting
good job now lets make it 3 months then 6
Congratulations comrade MediocreRub
That is painful to hear that you went through that pain...pls stay strong as you have been for a month
This.. does put a smile on my face
Congratulations!!
Congratulations! Keep this up!
I'm not judging I'm just wondering why people cut themselves? Does cutting makes them feel better?
Ayy u did such a good job that I was confused at wtf u were talking about. Keep it up mate and you‚Äôll be able to permanently forget the nightmare
Nice fookin job. Drinks on me
proud of you my man
yee bro im really proud of you!!
Proud of you! Keep it up! Hope you're in abetter place mentally and physically.
This made me smile so wide!
HELL YEAH BROTHER! THATS THE SHIT RIGHT THERE KEEP IT UP!
That's awesome. Never be ashamed of your scars. You are a warrior.
Great job mate!
Bravo man! keep it up. We are here for you

Might want to mark nsfw bc this could trigger someone who struggles with this.
Congratulations bro!  It's a terrible feeling to have to hide yourself like that, you feel so helpless, I know.  But I'm glad to see your skin cleared, it's a huge motivator and I'm happy to see your excitment :)
We are so proud of you! if you ever feel sad or lonely or if you just want to talk to someone make a post and we will support you in very way we can! &lt;3
Sick and tired of people in the comment section acting like they have self harm all figured out when they‚Äôve never experienced it. No, it is not always for attention. It is usually to get the brain to slow down via endorphins so someone can think clearly during a state of panic. If you haven‚Äôt expirienced, stop acting like you know everything about it because you clearly haven‚Äôt even tried researching a damn thing. Proud of you OP, things get better. 

(7 months clean)
Well done I‚Äôm proud of you
Nice dude!! Keep it up
Good for you! I'm 2 years clean, keep going!
Fuck yes. Now let's get to two months
Congratulations! Keep it up!
good
Yes Sir. Bravo!
Don't wanna be insensitive, but what leads most people to cutting themselves? Haven't ever done so intentionally, so I am a bit curious.
For some reason I seem to be one of the only people on this subreddit that doesn't engage in self harm or has suicidal thoughts. Still, congrats!
Hey so after scrolling through many comments of other teenagers who are also trying to get better/would like to get better I would just like to share this uhm.. quote?? It's kinda long so I'm not really sure if it's a quote- but it's a small bit from a book I'm currently reading. This really hit me hard the first time I read it but I know it probably won't for others but I still thought it would be nice to share. The book is called "turn your pain into art" by a woman named Ariel Bloomer. Now the difference between this and other books about overcoming inner pain is that Ariel has gone through the same shit as all of us and she's no "professional" white middle aged man who thinks he knows everything. It's sorta a book about her life and how she found a way to self-love and her way out of self-hate and self-harm over the years. I found this book because I'm a fan of her band (called Icon For Hire) which is like an emo/punk band but with a rather good message (if you like that music style you should definitely check them out too they're so underrated)

I wasn't sure where exactly to cut it from but I decide here would be the best but I recommend reading the whole book it's available online and everything and doesn't cost that much

.

.

.


"So darling, if you self-harm, please stop.

When you do this to yourself, you are flirting with suicide, and that's a powerful invitation of self-hate into your life. When you make sacred space for mental and emotional anguish, you essentially make it feel welcome by inviting the pain to take its jacket off and stay for awhile.

You *can* stop. You *can* heal, slowly, one minute at a time.

Since you are already creating sacred space for your pain, I'd like to invite you to get in the habit of doing that in a different way. Make a list of alternative practices you can partake in the next time you get the craving of hurting yourself.

Draw on your body. Journal it out. Go walking or swimming or hell, punch a pillow. Call a trusted friend who can talk you through your feelings. Kiss your wrists. Light a candle, put on some new music, and dance around your room to celebrate the freedom on it's way to you. 

The simple act of creating a moment of diversion can be enough to confuse your cravings and let some light in.

Just start where you can. Decide ahead of the pain what you will do the next time you feel the need to harm. 

When you feel weak, pause to feel my love and all the love in the universe that is available to you. There's freedom on the other side of your pain. You are amazing, and brilliant, and powerful, and I want you to feel that way. 

I want you to inspire the world, scars and all."

*-Ariel Bloomer 2018*

Now what I like about this and her whole book and her songs and all is that I actually don't feel like all she cares about is just us not hurting ourselves physically? Which I feel like many books and parents and friends and professionals do. I just feel like they only care about it not being physical. Like as long as I don't have scars they can see they wouldn't give a fuck. I just feel like that's putting the focus on the wrong thing. It should be about stopping the self-hate and pain we feel inside, considering the fact that all this on the inside makes us want to hurt ourselves physically and it being the whole reason we do it, and not on just stopping the physical self-harm but the emotional and mental SH. A little before where I cut the quote she talks about how SH'ing only works temporarily and over long time essentials just invites in more pain and rather than stopping the hurt It just makes the hurt worse in the long run, which is a valid reason to stop (compared to just having "spotless skin" and the arguments "oh no you were so pretty before" and "what about when it gets hot outside! Won't you be sad?").
Great one mate keep it up üëç
*LOUD APPLAUSE*
Good job man
That's amazing bro!!! Keep up the great work dude.
That's a strong man brothers
Good job keep it up
I wish I could say this too but having a crazy cat prevents me from having clean arms. Good job bro, you are amazing.
I salute you.
Let‚Äôs goooooooooooo
Great!
Keep it up. Its a very hard addiction to break. I still sometimes struggle with the compulsion to self harm after 10+ years "clean" but am very happy that i have been able to resist. The days turn into a month which turns into months which turns into years, and you will get there too my friend. &lt;3
Also is there any way we could make this nsfw? It could be triggering for someone struggling with self harm. i mean no offense.
I am so proud of you! at the moment im five days clean and I hope I can get to where you are one day
Enjoy your hard-earned happiness, my dude
Congratulations!!! I‚Äôm so proud of you, stranger:) keep it up. Ignore all the assholes in the comments, please. Don‚Äôt allow them to get in the way of your recovery. Some people don‚Äôt understand why people cut or why people post about it. I‚Äôve been there. I just wanted someone to be proud of me, y‚Äôknow? Anyway, I hope you may fully recover some day&lt;3 and remember, relapse is part of recovery, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you slip a little bit. I know you can do this!!
We are all with you
I‚Äôm about 2 months so we‚Äôre in this together
Good job! Keep up the good work. Stopping is really really hard, but once you get into that rhythm, your life is better. Like I said good job ü§ç
hey goodjob my guy, im clean for more than a year, scars wont fade for me tho lol, you got this
Maybe put an nsfw tag or spoiler tag on it?
As a boomer teenager I am proud of you son (am 19)
Great job
Hope you‚Äôll stay cut-free in the future

Good luck!
Dont feel self conscious about your scars. They show your battle and victory over depression. Keep doing what you are doing. Bless up
Nice job mate, on the same token it‚Äôs not the end of the world if you slip up. Proud of you stranger
I'm curious on how how some of you guys are able to cut yourselves so easily? I used to have depression and i didn't do it because i was too much of a pussy to handle it
please don't take this in the wrong way because I am genuinely curious, why do people cut themselves? what does it do for you? Im 15 and I've been through rough times but I could NEVER see me trying to hurt myself, I'm actually really curious I've been wondering this for a while
Do you know how wonderful this is? You did this. Proud of you.
Hey man, way to go. I know it can be hard sometimes not to self harm, But fuck, you got this bro.
It's been one year for me! Keep going strong, once you stop it becomes easier and easier.

You got this!
I'm proud of ya
School: Bro? What the heck??? Fighting is illegal bro!!!!!
What‚Äôs the other dude look like?
I want to let you know that you are awesome!
I pushed him back into the lockers  because he was being aggressive and got popped, it wouldn‚Äôt stop bleeding and this was my third gauze, after which I was pinned to the floor and kicked. I got ice cream tho
holy shit that's fucking metal, go team! Majorly proud of you, it might seem like a bit of a step back to you but this is definitely a big win, shows you have a good confidence in yourself, make sure you know that you can and will be better than those people.
It's horrible how it's bad to defend yourself from the school's point of view. One time I was literally told by the school after one incident to not even defend myself or fight back. Just stay limp and let the bully continue to punch you while you verbally tell him to stop. Anything else and you will get suspended for 2 weeks minimum.
I am extremely proud of you OP, you did the good thing, you stood up for yourself like a real man and that is what matters, you may not have won the fight, but who cares, he now knows what you can do. Cheers pal! Hope you get better and that bully gets his ass kicked
King you almost dropped your crown
[removed]
Omega chad move
If he doesn't stop punch him in the eye next time
if you get suspended take it as a reward
Ah, shit. Umm. Uh. 24!
People still bully? Kinda irritates me but congrats on standing up. I‚Äôd say try to set up a system where you can actually stand up to one without having to get hurt in the process though. I didn‚Äôt go to a middle or high school where bully was common. Everyone stuck with there own group and being ‚Äúpopular‚Äù was being smart. I feel bad for you but I also appreciate your effort.
[deleted]
We're all proud of you kid :)
Im proud of you, good work!
I hope you get a nice scar. 

Not because I want you to suffer, but because I want you to feel pride everytime you look in the mirror!!!
Lucky. The last time I (14f) did that I got a black eye and a suspension. If I get in to one more fight I have to go to online school for violence. It's stupid. Maybe don't seat me next to a fucking pervert and sexist(16m) I won't break his nose again. It's that simple.
well done mate, proud of u for fighting back lol

solid move of u
Did you kick his ass?
Next time, try out the [Monkey Steals the Peach](https://imgur.com/mfRvk) technique.

Its the secret ass juice of boys...
My sister is a cosmetologist, she says that a lot of skincare products you can buy are filled with lngredients so that they'll work on more skin types.
Sometimes only 5 of the 20 ingredients in the product is good for YOUR skin, it really depends on the product and the person using it. 

You might have an allergy for one of those ingredients making it seem like your skin is not improving

I suggest you go to a cosmetologist and hear what she has to say.

If you have any questions then i will gladly forward them to her.
Reverse psychology,the acne don‚Äôt know what you planning so it works out
Same with me and my sister she is on this huge diet to lose weight and it‚Äôs not really working 
But I can eat all the shit I want and I remain skinny
Why don't just go to the dermatologist and follow a pharmaceutical treatment?

I am right now following a Dercutane 400mg treatment works great and is permanent.

Comercial things normally aren't the best option.

EDIT: I am not promoting the use of Dercutane nor any similar product, I am just saying that having medical assistance is much more useful than a lot of comercial products.
Tells you something about skin care products.
Simple, stick your face in his ass
When I actually use the stuff meant to stop acne for me it makes it worse
I asked a dermatoligist and he said that it could be due to either genetics, stress, or just plain hygiene. I am currently under treatment, 20 mg of isotretinoin daily, for 8 months. Tomorrow I finish my first month. Hope the best for you :)
Drink lots of water

Don't take hot showers, it dries out your skin

Don't use vaseline or oil based lotions
Don‚Äôt you know? You get acne by touching your face!
ƒ∞ts really simple, we as men start shaving at like 15's. So evertime gilette goes throuhg, it takes all the shit from your face an dwhen you do it every week or more at teen ages your face goes boom.
The human body is full of mysteries...
i have freckles so hah!

perfect concealment &gt;:3
Seriously folks, the key is drinking water. I know it‚Äôs cliche but it‚Äôs so so true
Lol I‚Äôm the brother.(but in reality it‚Äôs because a couple of years ago I had face paralysis so I took a medication that is also used in the treatment for acne, since the dose I took was like 20x stronger than what‚Äôs used for acne treatment u haven‚Äôt had issues since even when I take horrible care of my skin)
Overusing things designed to make your skin better can make it worse, also there tends to be a higher standard of appearance for girls
Oh yeah lots of skin care products are shit
bruh i never had a probelm with spots and just didnt do anything to my skin, maybe just try letting ur skin vibe for a bit
He has a very special skin care routine
Can confirm so many kids that are 13 already have really bad acne and I usally have like 5 pimples at a time at most
Pimples are like printers, they sense fear. Ignore them and they‚Äôll go away.
It also depends on what temperature you shower with. A friend had acne when he took hot showers, then when he changed to cold he had little to none left
I think I saw something about this, does he use head and shoulders or anything that helps with dandruff
try wiping your face with the same towel you wipe your butt with
One time I got literally puched- like *painful* punched- in the arm by a "friend" because I told her I never had problems with acne even though I hardly ever wash my face.

I was like dude you realize I can't control it any more than you can right?
There's your answer
The more you worry, the more you stress the more you get. Seriously, if you spend the time you use on skin in your bed sleeping, that's like 70% of the battle.

Enough sleep
Reduce stress

Then apart from that don't touch your face, and that's about all you can really do.
The tip is to get ass juice on your face
I just stopped to eat chocolate and pork, works for me
He may be on to something
Gladly, acne only hit me lightly on the forehead
Of course you'd think that people would wipe their face first...
Maybe the skin care routines that you are taking don't improve your skin quality over time and just provide temporary relief and leave your skin worse over time like some chap sticks so you'll keep buying your product. Or maybe the ass juices really are something special.
People with the worst acne have the greatest glowups
the problem is that youbare doing it multiple times which have the adverse effect, only wash your face twive anymore than that is going to irritate the skin
Your face becomes reliant on the moisture of the face wash and stops producing its own moisture. You aren‚Äôt supposed to do it every day bc it‚Äôll dry out your face and worsen acne.
\*sniff\* :(

Such a struggle
You‚Äôre not using too hot of water are you?
Those ass juices really help with skin

1-Me playing Minecraft and seeing its monsters.

2-Me seeing CoD and RE monsters.
In my country we have a series that investigates the dissapearence of people in the country.

There are over 600 cases,mostly children,with no traces,no eyewithneses and no corpses.

Human trafficking could be a very good explanation but

"Paranoia intensifies"
Actually I be jackin it not eating hamburgers when I watch em
Don‚Äôt F*ck With Cats. A really good documentary on Netflix
Why would I be scared of seeing myself on TV?
Those documentary's are interesting as hell
Answer is simple, things that we don't understand because they don't exist or we haven't figured them out scare us, we know people murder eachother but ghosts on other hand, they may not exist but if they do we don't understand why or how, kinda same with Aliens, we aren't sure they exist but if they do we won't know anything about them, in short we are afraid of unknown.

When I was a kid a woman up the street from me was murdered in her sleep and then had her house set on fire. The killer has not yet been caught. The movie the dark crystal scared me more than this
Repost
‚ÄúOh no! The big man with a ski mask is going to stabby stab Sharla in the back!‚Äù Nate exclaimed while there is a literal murderer next door.
Ah yes, me too like sitting around with my ghosts and watch a good movie
Wtf is the first e
Imagine being the type of person that'd watch a horror movie and then sleep with one leg hanging over the side of the bed.
Cause documentaries aren't out to cheaply jump-scare you
Yea CUZ a murderer won't freaking care about me
You just described the entire population of Mexico. (Source: I‚Äôm Mexican)
# it's the FIRST SERIOUS AND REASONED USEFUL MEME I SEE (SERIOUSLY)
It has to do with horror movies showing the antagonists as unstoppable. Serial killer documentaries show the limits of killers and what weaknesses they took advantage of to commit murders. So you know that you basically just lock your doors and you'll be safe. Whereas horror movies are designed to make you feel absolutely helpless no matter what you do.
Netflix time!
When you read murder cases constantly and half of them happened like an hour away from where you live
They'd like this over at r/lpotl.
A real murder in my country ha ha laughs in America
"Don't fuck with cats" had me up for 3 hours past bed time because I was so freaked out by it, even though the guy is in jail and also across the Atlantic from me. But I have thrice happily listened to podcasts right before bed about gruesome murders which happened within my lifetime, within walking distance from where I live, all unsolved, and slept like a baby afterwards.
professionals have standards
The other day I watched a lot of documentaries about tragic incidents, the Lockerbie air disaster or Aberfan landslide among the others.

Woke up twice that night.
Can't deny it's interesting.
Serious question: How is this done?
You should drink ICEE
spook
Opposite for me
[deleted]
Don't worry, most people that got murdered are those who socialize.
The 2nd picture is me watching 50/50
Stolen
Well, you don't have the capability to arrest and incarcerate a ghost
I live in a home were widows died but I'm still more scared of some horror movies
Meh
Sad truth
I just got stabbed in the heart because this is too relatable
Well one's meant to be scary, the other is meant to educate.
And then there is me, watching both withiut much effect
Most documentaries abt murderers i watch, they usually go like "this person is dead tho" so i rest easy
It‚Äôs scarier because if we get attacked by a murderer we can just fight back, run, or go to a police station. But if it‚Äôs a ghost you can‚Äôt do shit
Legit the killler inside about Aaron Hernandez is a great documentary to watch tho
And if you hear about the serious danger of smoking cigarettes you're not even interested.
i mean, it's better to watch movies with ghosts than alone
#i n t e r e s t i n g
Other way for me
Yea fr fr
Yeah yeah but in the documentaries the killer is always found before it‚Äôs made
Me watching "Don't Fuck With Cats" like:
Because ghost movies are supossed to be scary, and murder documentaries are supossed to be interesting
Most of the murder documentaries take place 10 mins away from where I live
r/patrig
(city)
Relatable
Weird im the exact opposite. I know ghosts and shit aren't real, but there are crazy people everywhere
I'm the opposite..  paranormal shit doesn't scare me at all (ghosts, demons etc)...   But true crime shit is horrifying...
That should say county. America is really fuckin big
Im the exact opposite
Exactly! fictional stuff for me is jusst.. "*possibly in michigan*"? Fucking horrifying. "*you dont fuck with cats*"? Rewatch that shit 3000x
Sorry for intruding from r/all but I just want to say that this changes when you get older. You'll start to realize that humans are evil and will destroy everything. Have a nice day!
*falls asleep to unsolved murders*
Well, isn‚Äôt the difference between a horror movie and a documentary?
Nah friend that‚Äôs kinda **thicc** tho ngl
It's the other way around for me
Uh no its the Hash-Slinging Slasher
Whats that on the first e?
Lmao this is so true
100% reversed

Tbf it‚Äôs kinda **thicc** tho ngl
I‚Äôm the polar opposite
No truer post...
Pretty right on.
my friend likes to listen to podcasts about peoplr being murdered close to where we live when she sleeps and I am disturbed by it

Smh is this for real?

When I was 8 years old, I asked my mum for a longer shift at the factory where my boss would beat me if I showed up late to repair the machinery which required me to squeeze into tiny perilous spaces at the risk of getting severely injured, all while combatting the lung disease I got from inhaling coal fumes for the duration of my 18 hours shifts which were split in half by a 10-minute lunch break during which I'd eat a piece of stale bread.

Instead she got me a DS. Y'all don't know what you're missing out on
I would also be sad if i was so bored i would just look at machinery
I'd like it if child labour stopped existing
Yes because boomers were born during the industrial revolution
Okay,  B o o k e r
[deleted]
I can confirm I don‚Äôt wanna die at an early age
That one on the right is from the early 1900s.
Yeah the pic is too old for a meme about boomers, but guess what. The word school comes from the Greek word skhole, meaning leisure or free time, and it comes from the time when the lucky kids went to school in the morning and all the other kids went to work.

If you guessed that I was told this by somebody who heard me complaining about school you guessed right.
New soup was R A D as a little kid
Back in my day this was our ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù or one of those ‚ÄúPlaystations‚Äù
Child labor laws are ruining this country
Ew, look at that kid playing Mario 64 ds instead of risking his fingers for 2 pence a week!
I miss the days that us kids suffocated via CO2 exposure at age 6
Omg... This was like 1800s, do yall even know what a boomer is?
You know My Grandma Told me Very Early computers Were size of Whole Rooms
Boomer: You kids these days have it way TOO easy! Me: Wasn't that the point though?
Fun fact: 0% of boomers have lived during the industrial revolution
How old do you think boomers are? This post is retarded
it looks like the 60k people who upvoted this don't know when the industrial revolution occurred and how old baby boomers are. nice.
This isn‚Äôt even a boomer lol. Boomers did have it pretty good though. They didn‚Äôt have it better than our generation simply due to technology, but they were the first generation to really be ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù by their parents.
The Greatest Generation
Ok zooker
This picture is from the industrial revolution in the 19th century, not something many boomers went through. It was also mainly in europe
Boomers parents did factory work when they were young. Boomers were spoiled rotten because their parents created a booming economy and were able to aford many of the things they wanted. I get that this was a joke, I just felt it necessary to add this.
The industrial revolution was in the 1850‚Äôs not after the war.
Do you know when boomers were born and when child labor was outlawed?

Ya stupid
Bro do you got terraria on your 3ds?
Back then u didnt have to worry about school shootings and global warming i guess.
Lil bit earlier than boomers but whatever
I‚Äôm pretty sure if your parent was a child laborer your actually a boomer.
I know it's gonna sound bad but I wouldn't mind working in a factory at my current age,15, because, as long as I'm still able to go to school I'm absolutely fine with working in factory conditions for money.
and now you only have to take some time to find your passion and we might some day have a nice earth

Ah yes, I also hated the time most boomers worked in horrible factory conditions of the world wars
This photo is from 1929, weren‚Äôt boomers first born in 1946?
There was like at least a half century in America where kids ran around outside until dinner time.  I know memes are supposed to be dumb, but I can never tell who believes what.
I'd rather use my hands for a controller rather than losing them in an unsafe factory
Well in the old days of the 50s, in the USA, you could get a factory job and buy a house and raise a family with that money. You could go to college for like $10 or something. Buy a car from one summer of mowing lawns ($400).

You were almost guaranteed to get married by 20. 

The parts of life that are shitty now were so easy back then, that leisurely recreation itself had a boom back then.
no no please understand I just hate children
Funny, but this is most likely from the industrial revolution.
Generational divides are the new astrology signs.
What is that? (not the ds)
Booker, I found some money!
To be fair, child labor laws are pretty old in the U.S.. Boomers didn't grow up working in factories either.
Do you guys really not understand that Boomers made these same jokes 60 years ago?
Boomers**
They're talking about the 1960s, not the 1860s.
Ok Booker
Y‚Äôall can we just appreciate the DS Lite though??

Like goddamn what a beautiful system. You could play all your gba games on it, the system would make a slightly different startup sound on your birthday, and the library of games was astounding.

I remember playing Super Scribblenauts in bed some nights, as well as laying on my kitchen floor trying to clean fossils in Fossil Fighters. When I was 9 years old, my mom bought me a copy of SoulSilver for christmas, and it ended up being my favorite game ever.

What a rad fucking system.
Those damn *BOOKERS*
My dude, that's not even a boomer, that's a boomer's parent lmao. I mean hell, if this is a 10 year old in 1900-1910 it might be too old to be a boomer's parent.

Good old days, that picture is industrial era 1890s

That‚Äôs not a boomer that‚Äôs your dead great great grandpa.
Hmm. Not sure how many boomers worked in factories on new looking machines that were manufactured in 1893.  My guess is the child in that photo on the right would be somewhat over 100 years old today.
That's still pretty much the wrong generation. Check wikipedia for  the range during which bookers were born.
Boomer: anyone born between 1800 and 1999.

Keep it tarded.

Industrial revolution I see. We are actually learning about this in my history class
Here‚Äôs a tip, teenager. Book(m)ers did not work in Victorian textile mills. When do you think the Baby Book(m) began, 1830?
Boomers are not that old
Baby boomers didn‚Äôt grow up in the 1890‚Äôs
Child labor was before the boomer generation.
Boomers were around during the industrial revolution didn't know that
I can guess what the response to this will be bit, that picture in the right is a generation before the baby boomers.
Bruh that machine is dated 1903. That kid would not be a boomer.
This seems kind of stupid
I'd rather be playing Minecraft then staying in an air raid shelter because of ongoing world wars.

Ok booker
my dad is a boomer and he lived in soviet Lithuania. He only talks about how he read a lot and how much more music he knew than others just because he had  a neighbour who had relatives in canada

Low self esteem and virginity have nothing to do with actual talent and self worth. **Don't** focus in on sex so hard, especially if you're still young. Nobody gives a fuck that ur a virgin bucko
Now that is epic. Enjoy the car man
holy i got like really surprised i dont know why i didnt expect that
That's sick as fuck have my upvote

Yo... that‚Äôs kinda hot üò≥
Don't worry. Someone out there in the world would like someone like you. You just have to wait. 



Also cool Lego build bro.
that‚Äôs sick!
If you don't get laid for this, those bitches don't know a hot piece of **M A N** when they see it.
Dude,  that looks awesome. Cars are some of my favorite things,  this looks better than many of the Lego car kits in stores.

I would buy this kit
Virgins rule!!!
Um guys I'm not here for awards or upvotes but I want to kill my self I don't have enough karma to post so I'm putting this were someone can see. my sister Is going to the mental hospital cause she talked back to our stepdad idk what to do
Yes I‚Äôm a virgin as well, yes I don‚Äôt have self esteem. I can‚Äôt make anything like these. Great job my friend (::
Wwhat model is that?
I‚Äôd love to own something like a 1977 450 SL
LEGO is just cool! Nothing to woory about man! It has nothing to do with that you are a virgin, you aren‚Äôt silly or anything, keep doing what you like! Cool car too!
Don't beat yourself up over virgin bit. Getting laid doesn't change anything about your life unless being a virgin weights heavily you down. Honestly life will never get better if you don't work on any mental issues that might be keeping you down. Many of us have given up already but don't be one of us, work on yourself, keep doing the cool hobby you have, talk about your hobbies with people that care about them. Don't have such people? That's temporary and while you are seeking them, learn to enjoy things alone and be fulfilled. Choose the right university program and it could be a step to the best part of your life. World is a half chance and all that we have under our control is ourselves so take care of that self, cherish it and raise it. Take care of your inner child - teach him what confidence is and what areas are worth being confident about (freakin Legos obvs).

Life never stops unless we die, nothing is decided and you have every chance to start something new and exciting. Even if it is something as silly as bug watching (bugs are awesome). Our lives are in our hands.
Uh, what does that have to do with being a virgin? It looks great!
Who needs intercourse when you can watch this for hours?
Yeah sex is cool, BUT HAVE YOU EVER MADE AN ACTUAL GOOD CAR WITH LEGO?
You led it wrong. You gotta say, 

Yeah sex is cool but yall mf's make a rc Mercedes out of LEGO
To be honest that shit is attractive as fuck. if I was a female I'd be all over that.
Woahh :0
Holy shit dude, nice! I wish I could build as nice as you...
What Can I Say Except I'm Proud Of You?
Virginity is cool
Stay pure
Girls after seeing this: ‚ÄúOh no! The bra fell off!‚Äù
Damn, I wish I could gift you some self esteem cause that is dope and you should be proud.
That is the single best thing I've seen today :0
"I've been watching this for hours"
Woah if only the irl car had automatic roof
you forgot jfk
As a car guy and a classics car fan

I LOVE THIS
How would you like to graduate from being a virgin? If you show me how to make it I‚Äôll help.
You earned my respect. Take this upvote.
This is so cool and so are your other mocks like the PBY Catalina
Looks nice, great job!
I'm literally in love with you. We can smash, if you bring the lego mercedes too
Ay, this is pretty frickin' cool. This was without instructions, right? Super awesome.
You're lying ur not virgin
I like how the hardtop just crushed the passengers skull when it collapses
That's so freaking cool! I'm 19 and still buy mostly LEGO with my money, but I don't have the skill for MOCs like that. Amazing work, man.
That‚Äôs amazing! Are you gonna take a robotics oriented career path?
Bro how tf u a virgin, u need to have this on you at all times. While ur just casually flirting u gotta hit em with that casual flex ‚Äúyeah I make a lot of high tech LEGO stuff, no big deal‚Äù and just whip out the LEGO Mercedes. Trust me as the roof goes down so do the panties
You‚Äôre going to make a ton of money when you‚Äôre older if you keep doing stuff like that

Keep learning cool shit. Next learn how to give it power and control it from your keyboard. Just need a raspberry pi
Idk man seems pretty neat
God damn mate that's awesome as hell. I would love to see you do a time lapse.
I dont need sleep i need answers. Where can i get one?!
Can someone give me amazon link?

Edit: Holy shit, Lego is expensive, sorry that you had to live with me when I was 7 mom
Hey OP, let me just tell you that that is one of the coolest technic car I have ever seen
Virgin is a state of mind, get rid of that mentality mate
If that doesn‚Äôt get you laid instantly, the people around you probably don‚Äôt have more than 3 braincells
Nah man that gets you all the girls or guys don‚Äôt judge
To be honest, this is awsome and you should be proud of yourself. You no longer have low self esteem coz your awesome and are getting validation from internet strangers :)
Post it on Lego Ideas!! I'd support it!
People like you are the friends I need in my life.
You have won life, girls are temporary, rc LEGO Mercedes are forever( maybe not but you get my point)
69420 horsepower
How long did that take you?
At least you‚Äôve got something most non virgins don‚Äôt have... talent
Don't worry about being a virgin, you can actually turn ideas from your head into real products. Become and entrepreneur or at least a badass designer of some sort.

On another note, if you want more self esteem I recommend weightlifting. It helped me immensely, well. That and I used to be overweight and spent a year losing 40lbs then spent another 6 months just trying to tone out my body.

If you're thinking about the military, that boosts your confidence a lot. Just need to continuously push your comfort zone.
Bro how are you a virgin thats fucking sick.
Hey man , humans have hobbies don‚Äôt put yourself down for enjoying something ! As long as you‚Äôre not hurting anyone or anything you‚Äôre cool
Dude this is awesome. The amount of work and love that went into this is incredible!! You should be proud of your mechanical talents.
bruh wtf that‚Äôs literally so cool omg, you‚Äôre certified cool cat if i‚Äôve ever seen one üò∏
Yo thats fuckin cool as hell
Thats rad, great job.
so fucking cool! awesome work man!
i love it
Nice build. Let's just hope the roof motors last longer than on a real SLK. Those things are a bitch to repair, cost half a kidney and are less reliable than my school assignment partners (and that is saying something).
I built a lego car that converted into a flying car. Then my brother broke it and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how I made it
Are you single?
This is absolutely amazing! Building in technic is really hard and the car looks absolutely stunning. The roof retracting is also super smooth and cool. Great build!
Like fuck you're a virgin, that's cool as shit!
1. This is a great build. Try to accept that you did something great and allow yourself to be proud of it.

2. Every day, remind yourself that you can do (and do) great things.
Now all you need is jfk and a sniper
What motors are you using with it?
If you‚Äôre really evil, the ‚Äúall B‚Äù answer key would have one or two random C‚Äôs
Psychology tests with pretty easy questions be like
I feel uncomfortable doing the same letter 3 times in a row
if a student finds out the teacher's plan though, they'll get full marks
At least she'll have them graded in like 10 seconds for each exam.

Ok guys I've only taken these kinda tests like 5 times in my whole life. And all of them were from State testing and I knew those people had machines because there were thousands of tests but I didn't think normal teachers had that kinda stuff.
That gives everyone so much anxiety.
That one kid who didn‚Äôt study for the fucking test and happed to put in that fucking pattern would be really fucking happy
What kind of satanist would do such a thing?
That teacher didn't realize that I can tell the students the answers.
Oh damn
Are these multiple choice test as easy as I imagine they are? I mean, you only have 4 possible answers, right? We don't have multiple choice tests in Germany, so I can't compare, but I feel like they would be easier, because you have some point of reference.
I'd go crazy
That one kid who didn't study and just chooses all B
How to get a student to fail 101
When the teacher knows the weak spot
This isn‚Äôt evil this is a guaranteed A. As soon as you figure out what‚Äôs going on you can just repeat the pattern. Obviously double check your answers are correct. I had a teacher that always had a pattern in his tests and he would throw in the occasional random B into a test that was all C‚Äôs but it wasn‚Äôt unexpected
imagine being the one student that got a 100% on this
The Kid that didnot go to school:oooh yea
Episode 1 season 1
one i was little the only reason i wanted to become a teacher was to make the entire test's question's have the same letter answer except one just to see everyone freak out internally and i also wanted to make one answer key have like a little picture of something random made out of the bubbles
Honestly it will reward any student with critical thinking skills.... halfway through the test, notice pattern, double check answers - finish test according to pattern and double check for outliers. 

I see this as an absolute win.
u/repostsleuthbot
Super easy 100%

If you didn't sleep through class you should know at least half with some confidence, from there you can see the pattern
Shave it off then run north west 200 meters to the right
This would‚Äôve been great 10 seconds ago. I was just in this retarded test... I‚Äôve got like 2 right. FUCK!
Isn't that supposed to be Ricardo?
So in my history class in middle school, there was a huge problem of people not reading the instructions on tests. So one day my teacher wrote in the final sentence of the instructions that all the answers were C. Half the class got A+ while the other half did not
What about the kids at the back of the class on their phones lol
Every single question could be‚Äù2+2=?‚Äù
A)0
B)4
C)2
D)1

And I still wouldn‚Äôt choose B more than 3 times in a row.
thanks for the SAT cheat sheet!
I had a chem professor who never did this... until the final. After almost two stressed filled hours of doing my best on the test I was left with a pattern. I doubted my answers and changed some last minute and got up to turn it in. He looked at my paper, then looks at me with a snide grin and said ‚Äúwhat, you didn‚Äôt notice the pattern?‚Äù It still hurts.
I'm weird I know but when I see a pattern in a test I never question it. I go with what I th9nk the answer is and idgaf if it's bbbbbbbbbb or abababab etc.
If a teacher ever did that to me someone will be going down
Am I the only one that has a competition betweeen a, b, c, and d to see who gets the most answers?
Well I'm getting 100%
Eventually they‚Äôd catch on tho
Yo wtf that all multiple choice lucky sob
Should have one thing be different on each one just
 To make them feel relief for a quick second
Being Irish, or maybe European in General, I don't understand these, why do y'all have so many questions?
No that‚Äôs beutifle
You are a monster
Just watch as the third time he does this all the students gets it right
Now make one random question a different letter, no matter how easy the question is they will get it wrong
I had one of these before. Ah fun anxiety times
‚ÄúI expect all A‚Äôs!‚Äù
Monster
The kid just fucking about doing patterns is gonna be getting top marks üòÇ
Even when there's two B in a row I'm already confused
personally, i dont get bothered by this at all. If i get 3 in a row i see it as an answer streak.
One time my history teacher in 6th grade made almost the entire test the answer C. I tried to mix it up a bit because a lot of it seemed wrong, but my friend who picked every answer as C got a better score on it than me.
My dad is a teacher and once he put all the answers on a but only the last one on b
If i do the same letter for more than 3 times in a row, I just go fuck it if I can't positively think of another answer
German here,

Never had a test remotely looking like that but wth it seems so fucking easy just having to tick boxed
Some men just want to watch the world burn
I remember back in 11th grade i had a biology test with 40 questions , all of the answers were B except for the last one was A
I remember once on our exams the first three answers were A B A so I wrote by them mama Mia.. here we go again. I got an A on the exam and the teacher put a smiley face by my Abba reference
THEN JUST FOLLOW YOUR TEACHER, YOU'LL GET ALL THE ANSWERS THEN
Can you imagine some dumbass that doesnt care about exams just go all b and get all the questions right
Doing the same letter in a row 3 times makes me have a fucking panic attack even if I know it's all right
This is why there is a whole science behind test composition and evaluation.
this is not that evil imagine breaking the pattern halfway through
I actually genuinely like it when the pattern looks like the one on the left
The smart kid when he answers the first 10 questions and figure out the teacher‚Äôs plan : if god exists he is fucking me
I feel like I could do the all B‚Äôs one coz I‚Äôd realise the trend and assume that‚Äôs the trick
no no no, make it a pattern, but change a few of the hardest questions
The Devil
My teacher had his initials be the answers for the final. 

MM
This would actually kill me
Anybody have one for the quiet kid? Basically just change the top the bottom should fit well
Edit: I'm very well experienced in the department
Stop calling me out
Same but I'm the bottom one both places.
You forgot listening to depressed music making you more depressed and then crying about how I'm like this and just given up and go to sleep at 5:00 Pm
I try to be the class clown but I end up not
Me in a nutshell
Or class clowns when they first get to a new class
I cant tell anyone, its my duty
Being funny enough to be a class clown r/absolutelynotme_irl
I do have a clown license
*"3, take it or leave it."*
I‚Äôm just a clown.
I‚Äôm a class clown at home but the same at school
I'm in this photo and I don't like it.
This is a personal attack
On the outside he skrt skrts but on the inside he hurt hurts
I felt that in a different level
Well I'm not funny in the first place so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I would say I feel attacked but no one finds me funny in the first place :)
HAHAHAHA THAT‚ÄôS ME IN THE IMAGE HAHAHAHAH
stop exposing me dude, they can't know my secrets
Shit nigga thats actually me
[deleted]
Yo is this a personal attack or somethin?!
Idk, I was a class clown and I was fine until my senior year when I got hit with depression and then schizophrenia. I was a class clown all along and dis fine til then.
This is true tho when im at school i try to be happy and uplitlfting, and attempt to make people laugh or make their days better, and go home and sit in solitude being mostly sad, or down, feeling like i did something wrong, or getting yelled at by my parents.
What would this meme mean if I was homeschooled
That hit home
We truly do live in a society
U gotta realize the darkness of this joke

To have 3.5 credits

U would have had to not attend all 4 years of high school accept for one semester just for the required financial course......

Damn
Man I'm 31 and this post somehow gonna meld my work nightmare into a school nightmare.
I‚Äôm in this photo and I don‚Äôt like it
Classfunny kid here, can confirm, we are just trying to cover up the fact that we are sad
[deleted]
now i want to hug all of the class clowns i know
Why is this so fucking accurate
I put out this funny vibe, bc I need the love and attention of others. But in my mind I‚Äôm so depressed, and if someone thinks negative of me, I think negative of myself.
this hit me like a truck
Danm never got roasted this hard.
Opposite case for me
I felt this in my soul.
can confirm
3.5 credits? what tf does this mean?
Here I was thinking I was on r/im14andthisisdeep
This is me but without the first panel
Why be a clown when you can be a joke

If the class clown clowns the class, who clowns the class clown?

How TF does one have only three credits by senior year
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true, but he shouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äù.

Dude can ppl stop making jokes about me
Bipolar disorder be like

If you think this is you, this probably isn‚Äôt you
i'm a freshman (don't bully me plz) n my school made us make a four year plan for high school, my total credits are like 52 lol. i'm gonna hate myself
Why it do be like that?
Even when I feel like I'm dying inside, I'm always full of the jokes around my friends. It's not like it's all fake- being around other people provides me a brief, at least partial respite from my own thoughts, and I can get really happy for short periods of time during those respites- but it's wack how I'm basically able to flip a switch and hide nearly all of my inner turmoil. It does come out in the form of dark jokes on a semi-regular basis, but other than that, I've got a pretty solid mask that pops up whenever the situation calls for it.
-im in this picture and i dont like it
Yea, can agree with that, had one friend of those
The ones that make others smile hurt the most.

I tried to talk about some computer games at the Christmas dinner table and my family didn't even care.
\*and friends. Especially with music, it's a little heartbreaking when you show your friends your favorite song and then they say this.
Alternatively, my family when I tell them my music preference
This is legit my parents. If I try to talk about anything related to electronics (games, music) they are like ‚ÄúYoU aRe So AdDiCteD‚Äù. Like if I‚Äôm talking about something I‚Äôm passionate about you can at least not be rude out of courtesy.

On your birthday too
[deleted]
Me: puts on my cool like indie alternative playlist of a bunch of super small artists

My dad: put something else on, I don't want to feel like I smoked a joint

my dad: *literally doesn't realize that I was super excited to talk about the songs and bands etc*
Me when i try to listen to my music
Legit I can tell anyone that I like anime, I can even tell my two sisters. But the only people I can‚Äôt tell are my parents cause I know all their gonna do is lecture me or tell me what‚Äôs wrong about it.
I mostly just go to my mom to show her dog or cat pictures/videos. If I start talking about games, stuff going on in a book series, or fantasy creatures I made up+drew, then she starts talking about how I gotta ‚Äúget back into reality‚Äù

When I go to my dad and talk about Minecraft or something he starts kinda relating it to other things that he does understand, and actually continues a conversation with a lil bit of interest- same with the weird fantasy creatures I draw and/or read about :&gt;

Edit: I realized while reading other comments that I never talk about music I like around my parents ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll go listen to certain songs, not like those songs, and then tease me for it like one of my old friends did
[deleted]
I listen to RichaadEB‚Äôs metal covers and basically my entire family dislikes it

Edit: also anime
Shit that happened to me so recently, I told my parents I needed new shoes but I wanted to have full authority over which I buy cause now it‚Äôs my money (I didn‚Äôt have time to go without them) and when I said what store I wanted to go to my dad said ¬´¬†Oh no I‚Äôm sure you never saw inside that store, it‚Äôs full of ugly shoes¬†¬ª I knew what kind of shoes they had. Later when I chose to buy red shoes my parents said ¬´¬†Well I guess the good part is that cars will stop when you cross the streets, did you see how bright they are?¬†¬ª Makes it real fun to go shopping with them
I remember 2 years ago when my dad found out I liked anime,he said something along the lines of "You know anime are just Japanese cartoons right?",but having our relationship pretty much destroyed at that time,I really didn't care about his opinion on it nor have I ever tried to change his mind like I used to do in the past(though it still hurt to hear talk about the" weird shit" I was into).Surprisingly,he's much more okay with anime and manga now,even buying me 2 manga volumes this Christmas and one for my birthday and sometimes even tries to chat with me about the animes I'm watching or the mangas I'm reading(even though  he's clearly not interested in them lmao).Our relationship is still not on good terms and never think it will ever be what it once was,but I'm glad he's atleast trying
I desperately want to give you an award, I agree with you so much
This happened when I tried to show my family Oscilloscope music.
Man i really feel bad for you all. My parents are the most wonderful people in the world and even if they dont always like what i do they always listen to me talk about it and they are always trying to do things that i like even if they dont always care for it i really feel bad for yall with not so good parents cause my parents are the best people in the world!

My dad found out I liked metal and took me to rock in Rio. I dont think he actually likes it, he's just supportive.
Thank god Dad used to listen to System of a Down back in the day
When my dad asks me what i like and answering anime tiddies and pussy isnt the rigt answer
Looking back I feel like a total asshole for calling my little brother gay once because he liked anime.

Now I just call him gay because he thinks One piece is better than jojo
Me and anime
My mom laughs at me whenever I want to be more eco-friendly, talk about comics/video games/movies, or state off random facts. My bad if I have I have a bunch of useless knowledge in my brain, I don't laugh at you when you watch soap operas in the summer.
i showed this to my mom and she laughed
Damn now I feel kinda bad about making fun of my fortnite playing brother
Me talking about anime or some western cartoons (like Avatar: The Last Airbender).  Video games, too.  My brother is somewhat interested in video games, but I like RPGs, and he likes competitive shooters.
I tried to share my love for mountain biking and it got shot down quick. I then tried to talk about a girl I'm interested in and they called her ugly
You know my dad really supported my passion for basketball always cheered for me and got other parents all hyped real fun

since he has died my mother has come to my game but she barely even watches them as she does something on her phone or whatever

It‚Äôs sad how well I can relate to this meme

On Christmas my grandpa randomly started talking about politics when no one asked
I showed my family the music vid for "no love" by death grips. the whole room was completely silent.

I love how people think teens below 18 can't handle NSFW stuff. Like somehow when you turn 18 a magic switch gets flipped?

Used to be just gold, then some corpo cunt had to co-opt reddit silver. Took a fun community meme and monetized it, fuckin asshole move if you ask me.

Edit: Thanks for the silver - except fuck your silver, reddit deserves nothing and awards are dumb.
Seriously, that‚Äôs back when getting an award was special. Now it‚Äôs just like a slightly better version of an upvote or a shitty reaction emoji
Back in my day we only had gold

At least she didn't plug them in the charger hole.

atleast she can say she got the usb in the right way 1st try

Haha I go to new school because we get better test scores we getting better funding. Feel the pain from old schools tho
where'd you get chrome 3? and how many minutes later did it open?
My school had some game creation courses so they invested a lot into the computers. They aren‚Äôt bad at all. Installed Minecraft and threw some high end shaders on (like one step below RTX or so) and it ran comfortably. 60-70 FPS average with 32 chunks and all particles. 

Now the personal devices they give out are garbage chrome books. I hate them sooo much. Their MacBooks last year performed so much better xd
Your school computers have Chrome? Some I used had Firefox but the most had only IE installed
I'm lucky enough to have a Debian installed on our informatics courses' computers, no worry with bloated Windows stuff for those poor little machines
Ore take away the affects and just put, "my school trying to load chrome with the 2gb ddr3 RAM
My school uses Chromebooks. So that's not really a problem for us.
I use firefox for a reason
Not only school computers
It sad how they want to take away ya phones and yet its f as r fast and more safer to use than a computer with all your school information including your health documents lmao so you damn know you know got less information in than the school
Diavolo at the end of Golden wind
Great days intro be like
For a few seconds the image was just loading and i genuinely thought that was the joke..
Firefox
Firefox ftw
your Chrome browser will never find truth.
ITT: JoJo references
Am I the only person who had iMacs at school? They were like from 2008 but still worked well with regular programs. I even used to play Eve Online on one of them, and another guy played dota2 instead of joining the disco during the new year party
I also know, that Chrome is a goblin that steals all of the memory you have, And even besides that after latest update when they disabled Flash, and all videos run on on HTML4 , they RE-Enabled Hardware acceleration - dick move! as it took me days on my poor GF1050Ti to understand WHY can't I watch videos anymore on one screen and play on another, and my game would stutter all the time... And it didn't stop there, instead of using it's usual 1gb RAM it gobbled up almost 2GB and my video games still suffered because there was not enough ram... as Chrome had used 2.6GB of Ram - right after launching it and Slack(which somehow uses Chrome in it's shell)..  well, for Work reasons I can't close either of them and I was forced to upgrade from 8GB to 24GB as 16gb kit was cheapest option.  Chrome - please fix memory leaks!!! Don't just force users to buy more memory!
For some reason I thought it said chromosome
FYI: Firefox is better than Chrome now. Chrome is trying to make it so you aren‚Äôt allowed to use adblockers... and it‚Äôs google so ya know. Switch to Firefox.
Me 5 hours ago: *sees the post at 5k updoots*

Me seeing it‚Äôs at 44.3k updoots: he did it. That crazy son of a bitch did it.
My school didn‚Äôt block pornhub they r now missing a laptop in boys bathroom hehe
Where am I who are you people
One of my friends brought some cupcakes to celebrate someones birthday and everyone started acting like she was their *best friend.*
Ngl i read it gun
You know the rules, and so do I.
Never give in. Learned that back in 5th grade
My school banned chewie (not the star wars character)and so nobody has gum
Hey
they literally can buy gum themselves and when i ask for some they go no no you dont get any
Yo but that requires money, I don‚Äôt have m o n e y
Ghetto chicks outta nowhere be like: BESSFRAAAAAANNNDDDDDDD
What's this thing you call "school"?
I'm just here to rick roll you guys!
The entire school: you know the rules and so do I
This is also the popular kids once one of the nerds/ not-so-popular kids finishes a worksheet
_You wouldn't get this from any other guy,_
Just stop opening gum in public
I kid you not i opened a pack of gum right before scrolling to this meme
I read gun xd lol
I serve the Soviet union
I always hated when that happened, I always said someone else gave it to me lol .
This also works with guns
AGHHH, anyways...
If you are those people who say anyone who does anything remotely noce to a woman is simping....


Rick Astley was a huge simp....
This happened to me after school one day. There was a girl that went to my elementary school and I hadn‚Äôt talked to her since 5th grade and now it‚Äôs 7th. I‚Äôm giving gum to my friends and she was like ‚ÄúOMG that‚Äôs my favorite gum!!!! Can I please have one!?!?‚Äù Then I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúSorry I don‚Äôt fuck with gold diggers‚Äù and walk away
you know someone could make an underground candy dealing company  maybe even sell not only gum but mints, smarties,m&amp;ms, hershey kisses, ect any candy your heart desires  at half of the cost of retail candy and with the added convenience of being at skool

who nows perhaps you can make over $120 in a week 

&amp;#x200B;

just a thought definitely not an idea that made me financially stable and got me suspended 

 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Oh god a decade ago in middle school I had a stockpile of like 20 packs of gum on the top cabinet portion of my locker in a nice stack like some preteen Smaug, and I opened it one time during recess and there were waaay to many kids around my locker that could see the fat stacc, and pandemonium ensued, everyone just rushed in at my locker, taking one or two packs each. Untill the frenzy died down and some came to the senses and realized it's not cool just to savagely take your classmates shit in front of everyone, so a few people gave me back the gum they took.
Poggers
The fact that this is posted right now is a crazy evidence that this is a brainless repost
Also when I open up my bag to reveal an AK-47
"dude c'mon I'll owe you"
Gum brings out the communist in everyone.
Sell it for like 50 cents a pop and then boom instant profit
opens a bag of gum:

All the school: [(( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)](https://www.lennyfaces.net/)
Bruh this meme was stolen https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
One of my friends saw me open a pack of gum and tried to snatch it out of my hands
Relateable.
 One of my friends brought some cupcakes to celebrate someones birthday and everyone started acting like she was their *best friend.*
This could have also worked with "you know the rules, and so do I"
the class bully: "you know the rules and so do i"
Never gonna give you gum
Back in middle school, some kids found out I had the good stuff, and after denying them they straight up broke into my locker and stole it.

The lengths kids go to for $2 worth of gum is insane.
  Oi OP this guy reposted your post a fuck ton on r/PewdiepieSubmissions, just wanted to let you know

https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/g66zdn/very_true/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
i remember when my classmate back in grade 4 brought 3 pizzas for his birthday, so many people were greedy for the pizza, we were close friends so i got to eat 2 slices of pizza, the pizza slices were big so i got full with just 2 slices
More like: the entire school

It was hand sanitizer for me :( 50ml aswell , some tiny ass bottle
Thought this said pack of cum
Or when you‚Äôre bringing flamin hot chips to schooo
I read this as gun at first
https://youtu.be/rbsPu1z3ugQ
Then you get punished for having gum
You know the rules and so do I
Lowkey starting to miss all these moments now that we‚Äôre in quarantine...
This isn't even a new thing.

There has been gum cravers ever since the creation of bubblegum.
*communism increases*
*U.S.S.R anthem starts playing*
[the new rickroll](https://youtu.be/BeyEGebJ1l4)
As a relatively old person here, it‚Äôs fucking me up that rickrolling is older than some of the people on this sub.
Not anymore! :)
Your heart's been aching but
Every day I use to bring 6 pieces a gum. I had 6 classes. End of story. This was explained every time someone asked me for a piece.
You know the rules, and so do I
This never happened to me when I've had gum, only baked goods. You have no idea how many kids at my school that I've talked to once come up to me and tell me as my best friend, they deserve cookie.
me: *pulls out a gun

the entire fucking school: we've known each other, for so long!

me: that's a fucking lie
u/McFly_505
You know the rules.
welcome to the club pal
Your gums been eatin' but your too shy to share it. Inside we both what is going on, you know the gum and I wanna chew it and if you ask me what we had. Don't ask me cuz I, want some gum.

So I was shoplifting at Walmarts......*my friend.....this guy who I have no connection with at my school was shoplifting at Walmart*
....aaaaand that‚Äôs how my mother found out about the time I went mattress surfing in the 8th grade.
"Okay, wait, no, actually-"
I was telling my dad about RDR2 and how you can kill people and steal their money, he got pissed and wouldn‚Äôt let me play for a while, then I explained more
Gets pulled over, starts confessing s*** he shouldnt be confessing... "sorry officer I'm a little high..."

I accidentally told my mom about that one time when my class stole the answer sheet to the finals
Haha imagine talking to your parents

This post was made by crippling apathy gang
Good fucking template
I almost gave myself away telling my mom about a story when I was high and walking at 4 am
This is one of the reasons why I'm getting more and more quiet and less and less expressive.
Another Post Malone template? Yes please.
"Yeah so my friend and I were having se-"

"You what!?"

"I mean my two friends were having sex but I'm obviously not because I'm a Redditor hehe"
I actually did this one, I was telling a story about me walking to this nearby bakery one day after school in middle school and I forgot my parents are strict af and that I had to cross the road to get there and so when they found out I ended up getting my dumbass in trouble

Lowkey was worth it though, that place had some good ass buttery bread
Does this happen before or after the long lecture
Congratulations you just played yourself
Ooooh man I just read "shit" instead of "snitch"... that was a ride
This was my dad when he accidentally revealed that he can't drink Fanta Lemon anymore because he used to mix it with alcohol when he was younger
This literally just happened to me. My dad and I both play games, however I‚Äôve been suspended from school and I‚Äôm not allowed to play any video games while I‚Äôm home. So my parents go out to see a show and I‚Äôm home alone. I decide on I play some Spider-Man on the ps4 and when my dad gets home he asks me, ‚Äúwhat did you do while we were out?‚Äù And to which I respond, ‚ÄúI beat Spider-Man‚Äù. Now they straight up took my consoles and PC to work with them
The plus side of not being good at talking to people is that you play the entire conversation in your head before hand, so when you‚Äôre planning what to say and you mess up, you can avoid blurting it out and actually messing up.
There was a halloween party where someone dressed as a furry and I was telling my mom then I had to explain to her what a furry was without sounding prejudiced
My parents asked if I smoke and I responded "smoke what?" like the fool I am. Man I'm a fucking idiot.
I feel like there could be a good story behind this, but then again it could be minor. What I'm trying to say is please tell me what happened I'm nosey
Literally happened 3 min ago, do you read minds?
i wanna tell so many great stories to my family but all of them are from when i was high as a kite
Mistakenly revealed I smoked lots of weed back in highschool, my parents can't do anything about it since I stopped a while ago and now live on my own, but still surprised them a lot
one time i almost snitched on my self for shoplifting
‚ÄûShouldn‚Äòt have said that.
I should not have said that.‚Äú
‚ÄúSo I was smoki-‚Äú

*‚ÄùYOU WHAT?!‚Äù*
What I do depending on this is I‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄúI told you guys about it, you probably don‚Äôt remember though‚Äù. As long as you play it off well, you‚Äôre usually set
[Conversely, returning home after your first semester of college](https://youtu.be/SLsTskih7_I?t=169)
Just fucking happened to me
This is one good reason that my parents don‚Äôt listen to me
Or when your telling a story and it doesn‚Äôt make sense without the one detail that will get you in trouble...
Lmao i had a dad that was pretty chill. But my mom.. This happened too many times..
Lmao this is how my mom found out me and my friends throw knives at each other for fun
This is how my parents found out I drink
me high af coming home late,my mom asks where i have been,my high brain answered "buying weed" instead of saying "i was buying chips"
I read ‚Äúswitch on yourself‚Äù and spent 10 seconds staring at the sentence confused.
Can I be a taste bud?
"Reminds me of this one time I was cutting class with..." and you stop before you snitch on your homies.
Eventually you get to a certain age where it's like "Yeah Mom, I've taken LSD before. No I don't do it anymore. Anyway back to what Rob was doing..."

I just did that but I was not lying and I said the wrong thing
My dad did that when he was like 55, lol.

Or when you accidentally cuss in front of them lol
I swear to god my siblings always do this, like do they just have a natural impulse to implicate themselves AND me for no reason. They‚Äôre so stupid no matter how many times I tell them they still do it
Aaand that's how I accidentally came out as bi ;-;
Lmaooo this is how my friend found out about me cutting myself
Aaaand that's how I found out my mom knows I smoke weed.
Even better when they act like they didnt hear it but they give you that look of dissatisfaction
That‚Äôs when you just say ‚Äúyes mom I literally told you this last week‚Äù and you will be off the hook like 90% of the time
I almost did this on Saturday, lol. My parents are pretty strict, and I was at a sleepover with my friends. The host‚Äôs parents weren‚Äôt home, so we were all there alone. I was telling a story about how we all fell asleep on their parent‚Äôs bed watching ratatouille. If my parents had found out that there weren‚Äôt any adults there they would have freaked and I probably would have gotten grounded.
Umm... Nothing!...I said nothing-

Yeah and I got in trouble- 



Uhhh no! That was just a joke, nothing else haha
I‚Äôve done this so many times
Thaaaaat feeeeeeel, yes, perfect face.
Shut up spleen!

Don't mind me I'm just talking to my spleen
Shouldn‚Äôt‚Äôve said that, I should NOT have said that
Shouldn't have said that. Should NOT have said that.
Post Malone looks like a dude who drinks bud light
Low key like that commercial lmao
As someone who doesn't bother following hip hop anymore, for a moment I thought that was Takashi 6ix9ine and I thought to myself, "Did he hire some PR firm to help him rebrand and get over the snitching thing?  Because if they did and they put him in a BUD LIGHT ad he's never going to hear the end of it.  He thought he was a fucking joke *before???*  Oh boy."
This meme was brought to you by Bud Light.
That‚Äôs how my mom found out the dent on her truck
How I accidentally told family about my eating disorder
That's how my mom found out im a smoker
I like this meme format, but it almost seems intentional.  Like they knew people would meme it so they made sure the logo was there.

[here is the proof of the cancer for those who still might be skeptical ](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dn9nfZrGEEMrwyAz9)
For context the type of cancer I had is called PTLD which is a post transplant lymph cancer. I had the second worst type and it was found a few months back in my tonsils and other places in my throat. I was lucky to have this type as I did not need chemo but I did need infusions of a medication called retuximaeb (I think it is spelled that way) we had a check this week for tumors and traces of ebv or mono in the blood as this can indicate the cancer and is what started it for me. The mono came back negative and no tumors were found on the pet scan. I hope this clears one things up if you have any questions please message me.
I‚Äôm so fricken proud of you dude, keep up the good work!

CONGRATS!!!!!!!! I had osteosarcoma from ages 8-10 in my orbital bone and cheekbone. Had to actually take a chunk out of my orbital bone and replace it with titanium plates. Chemo sucked too, I was pretty much the only bald girl at my school.

You're a fucking champion man, way to go!!!!!

Congratulations OP!!! 

I don't know what it's like with cancer but I know the feeling of looming you get with a chronic illness. I've had type 1 diabetes since I was about 1 and a half. I feel you there with the sadness but I happy for you!!
You should have pet her, not beat her, you absolute fucking monster.

In all seriousness, congratulations. My Mom went through and lived through cancer, so I know how that feels. Here's to a long and amazing life, my friend.
My dad just got into hospital today, because he has cancer, and he almost died, but the ambulance was quite fast, and now he is on oxygen and on very stong painkillers or what are those called. Sorry for my bad english and congratulations.

Somebody give this mad lad an award!
I'm so happy for you! This made me smile a lot!
So happy for ya. Fuck Cancer.
Technically you can't kill 100% of cancer cells. There's always a very small number of cancer cells within us every single day. It only ever becomes a problem when they multiply fast which then becomes a tumor. :)
Is this the real life
I'm proud of you ‚ù§Ô∏è I give you a hug through internet!!
This friggin awesome dude! I know what it's like to lose someone to cancer so I'm so frickin happy you've beat it
Cancer is such a scary disease! Good job beating it!
